Dante_Divine_Comedy = ["Above Man's war-wracked world a veteran throng Of singing spirits gather in the air, Called from the Poets' Heaven to take their share In Right's impending victory over Wrong.",
    "Far in their van the Eagle Eye of Song Looms o'er Ravenna, where he died, and where He saw God's Freedom in the dazzling glare Of visions, which to every race belong.",
    "Him his redeemed, united Italy — Her Alps new crowned with Monza's iron band, Her Hadria wedded with her Doge's ring — Hails as the Prophet-Bard of Liberty; And bids the free of every tongue and land Join in her Ave, and their tribute bring.", 
    "When lightnings kill at Jove's Olympian nod, When tempests drown at Neptune's stern command, Their deeds are His, whose face once cheered the land With smiles of love, whose feet the sea once trod.",
    "When Life had withdrawn me from all but my God, And the birth pangs of dying had ceased, Where now is the world, Lord, I asked, as I sighed, And the light of the sun, and the starlight, which vied With its glory, when I was released? —",
    "Asleep in my dreamland, God said with a smile Which lighted my soul's new sky, The real world is only where thou and I are; The earth is but space, and but sun-time each star To such as are thou and I. —",
    "Where, then, are my fellows and loved ones, I asked, The dead I had hoped to see, And the living I left, when to Thee I was sped? — Thy loved ones are dreams in my dreamland, God said, And real for thee only in Me;",
    "Hence all are here with thee, each separate soul As deathless, as each was dear.",
    "Look into My heart, and thy living thou 'lt find; Or call, and thy dead will awake in My mind. Enough that we two are here! —",
    "But why, though ashamed, am I feeling no dread, Now that here I am with Thee alone? That I was a sinner I know but too well, And that this is Thy Heaven.",
    "But what of the Hell, Where the guilty are said to atone? —",
    "A sin-born delusion, God said, as He sighed, A fear born of blindness and night; For Love, even now, is atoning in Me For all that thy world-life made sinful in thee, Ere death tore its veil from My Light. —",
    "But what, then, am I, whom our Oneness can thus Both humble and glorify? — A realized dream! from the Silence above Whispered He who is Lover and Loved One and Love, For lo! There is no One but I!",
    "When half way through the journey of our life I found that I was in a gloomy wood, because the path which led aright was lost.",
    "And ah, how hard it is to say just what this wild and rough and stubborn woodland was, the very thought of which renews my fear! So bitter 't is, that death is little worse; but of the good to treat which there I found, I 'll speak of what I else discovered there.",
    "I cannot well say how I entered it, so full of slumber was I at the moment when I forsook the pathway of the truth; but after I had reached a mountain's foot, where that vale ended which had pierced my heart with fear, I looked on high, and saw its shoulders mantled already with that planet's rays which leadeth one aright o'er every path.",
    "Then quieted a little was the fear, which in the lake-depths of my heart had lasted throughout the night I passed so piteously.",
    "And even as he who, from the deep emerged with sorely troubled breath upon the shore, turns round, and gazes at the dangerous water; even so my mind, which still was fleeing on, turned back to look again upon the pass which ne'er permitted any one to live.",
    "When I had somewhat eased my weary body, o'er the lone slope I so resumed my way, that e'er the lower was my steady foot.",
    "Then lo, not far from where the ascent began, a Leopard which, exceeding light and swift, was covered over with a spotted hide, and from my presence did not move away; nay, rather, she so hindered my advance, that more than once I turned me to go back.",
    "Some time had now from early morn elapsed, and with those very stars the sun was rising that in his escort were, when Love Divine in the beginning moved those beauteous things; I therefore had as cause for hoping well of that wild beast with gaily mottled skin, the hour of daytime and the year's sweet season; but not so, that I should not fear the sight, which next appeared before me, of a Lion, — against me this one seemed to be advancing with head erect and with such raging hunger, that even the air seemed terrified thereby —",
    "and of a she-Wolf, which with every lust seemed in her leanness laden, and had caused many ere now to lead unhappy lives.",
    "The latter so oppressed me with the fear that issued from her aspect, that I lost the hope I had of winning to the top.",
    "And such as he is, who is glad to gain, and who, when times arrive that make him lose, weeps and is saddened in his every thought; such did that peaceless animal make me, which, 'gainst me coming, pushed me, step by step, back to the place where silent is the sun.",
    "While toward the lowland I was falling fast, the sight of one was offered to mine eyes, who seemed, through long continued silence, weak.",
    "When him in that vast wilderness I saw, \"Have pity on me,\" I cried out to him, \"whate'er thou be, or shade, or very man!\"",
    "\"Not man,\" he answered, \"I was once a man; and both my parents were of Lombardy, and Mantuans with respect to fatherland.",
    "'Neath Julius was I born, though somewhat late, and under good Augustus' rule I lived in Rome, in days of false and lying gods.",
    "I was a poet, and of that just man, Anchises' son, I sang, who came from Troy after proud Ilion had been consumed.",
    "But thou, to such sore trouble why return? Why climbst thou not the Mountain of Delight, which is of every joy the source and cause?\"",
    "\"Art thou that Virgil, then, that fountain-head which poureth forth so broad a stream of speech?\" I answered him with shame upon my brow.",
    "\"O light and glory of the other poets, let the long study, and the ardent love which made me con thy book, avail me now.",
    "Thou art my teacher and authority; thou only art the one from whom I took the lovely manner which hath done me honor.",
    "Behold the beast on whose account I turned; from her protect me, O thou famous Sage, for she makes both my veins and pulses tremble!\"",
    "\"A different course from this must thou pursue,\" he answered, when he saw me shedding tears, \"if from this wilderness thou wouldst escape; for this wild beast, on whose account thou criest, alloweth none to pass along her way, but hinders him so greatly, that she kills; and is by nature so malign and guilty, that never doth she sate her greedy lust, but after food is hungrier than before.",
    "Many are the animals with which she mates, and still more will there be, until the Hound shall come, and bring her to a painful death.",
    "He shall not feed on either land or wealth, but wisdom, love and power shall be his food, and 'tween two Feltros shall his birth take place.",
    "Of that low Italy he 'll be the savior, for which the maid Camilla died of wounds, with Turnus, Nisus and Eur?alus.",
    "And he shall drive her out of every town, till he have put her back again in Hell, from which the earliest envy sent her forth.",
    "I therefore think and judge it best for thee to follow me; and I shall be thy guide, and lead thee hence through an eternal place, where thou shalt hear the shrieks of hopelessness of those tormented spirits of old times, each one of whom bewails the second death; then those shalt thou behold who, though in fire, contented are, because they hope to come, whene'er it be, unto the blessèd folk; to whom, thereafter, if thou wouldst ascend, there 'll be for that a worthier soul than I.",
    "With her at my departure I shall leave thee, because the Emperor who rules up there, since I was not obedient to His law, wills none shall come into His town through me.",
    "He rules as emperor everywhere, and there as king; there is His town and lofty throne.",
    "O happy he whom He thereto elects!\"",
    "And I to him: \"O Poet, I beseech thee, even by the God it was not thine to know, so may I from this ill and worse escape, conduct me thither where thou saidst just now, that I may see Saint Peter's Gate, and those whom thou describest as so whelmed with woe.\"",
    "He then moved on, and I behind him kept.",
    "Daylight was going, and the dusky air was now releasing from their weary toil all living things on earth; and I alone was making ready to sustain the war both of the road and of the sympathy, which my unerring memory will relate.",
    "O Muses, O high Genius, help me now! O Memory, that wrotest what I saw, herewith shall thy nobility appear!",
    "I then began: \"Consider, Poet, thou that guidest me, if strong my virtue be, or e'er thou trust me to the arduous course.",
    "Thou sayest that the sire of Silvio entered, when still corruptible, the immortal world, and that while in his body he was there.",
    "Hence, that to him the Opponent of all ill was courteous, considering the great result that was to come from him, both who, and what, seems not unfitting to a thoughtful man; for he of fostering Rome and of her sway in the Empyrean Heaven was chosen as sire;",
    "and both of these, if one would tell the truth, were foreordained unto the holy place, where greatest Peter's follower hath his seat.",
    "While on this quest, for which thou giv'st him praise, he heard the things which of his victory the causes were, and of the Papal Robe.",
    "The Chosen Vessel went there afterward, to bring thence confirmation in the faith, through which one enters on salvation's path.",
    "But why should I go there, or who concedes it? I 'm not Aeneas, nor yet Paul am I; me worthy of this, nor I nor others deem.",
    "If, therefore, I consent to come, I fear lest foolish be my coming; thou art wise, and canst much better judge than I can talk.\"",
    "And such as he who unwills what he willed, and changes so his purpose through new thoughts, that what he had begun he wholly leaves; such on that gloomy slope did I become; for, as I thought it over, I gave up the enterprise so hastily commenced.",
    "\"If I have rightly understood thy words,\" replied the shade of that Great-hearted man, \"thy soul is hurt by shameful cowardice, which many times so sorely hinders one, that from an honored enterprise it turns him, as seeing falsely doth a shying beast.",
    "In order that thou rid thee of this fear, I 'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard the first time I was grieved on thy account.",
    "Among the intermediate souls I was, when me a Lady called, so beautiful and happy, that I begged her to command.",
    "Her eyes were shining brighter than a star, when sweetly and softly she began to say, as with an angel's voice she spoke to me:",
    "O courteous Mantuan spirit, thou whose fame is still enduring in the world above, and will endure as long as lasts the world, a friend of mine, but not a friend of Fortune, is on his journey o'er the lonely slope obstructed so, that he hath turned through fear; and, from what I have heard of him in Heaven, I fear lest he may now have strayed so far, that I have risen too late to give him help.",
    "Bestir thee, then, and with thy finished speech, and with whatever his escape may need, assist him so that I may be consoled.",
    "I, who now have thee go, am Beatrice; thence come I, whither I would fain return; 't was love that moved me, love that makes me speak.",
    "When in the presence of my Lord again, often shall I commend thee unto Him.' Thereat she ceased to speak, and I began:",
    "O Lady of virtue, thou through whom alone the human race excels all things contained within the heaven that hath the smallest circles, thy bidding pleases me so much, that late I 'd be, hadst thou already been obeyed; thou needst but to disclose to me thy will.",
    "But tell me why thou dost not mind descending into this center from that ample place, whither thou art so eager to return.'",
    "‘Since thou wouldst know thereof so inwardly, I 'll tell thee briefly,' she replied to me, ‘why I am not afraid to enter here.",
    "Of those things only should one be afraid, that have the power of doing injury; not of the rest, for they should not be feared.",
    "I, of His mercy, am so made by God, that me your wretchedness doth not affect, nor any flame of yonder fire molest.",
    "There is a Gentle Lady up in Heaven, who grieves so at this check, whereto I send thee, that broken is stern judgment there above.",
    "She called Lucaa in her prayer, and said: ‘Now hath thy faithful servant need of thee, and I, too, recommend him to thy care.' Lucaa, hostile to all cruelty, set forth thereat, and came unto the place, where I with ancient Rachel had my seat.",
    "‘Why, Beatrice,' she said, ‘true Praise of God, dost thou not succour him who loved thee so, that for thy sake he left the common herd? Dost thou not hear the anguish of his cry? see'st not the death that fights him on the flood, o'er which the sea availeth not to boast? Ne'er were there any in the world so swift to seek their profit and avoid their loss, as I, after such words as these were uttered, descended hither from my blessèd seat, confiding in that noble speech of thine, which honors thee and whosoe'er has heard it.'",
    "Then, after she had spoken to me thus, weeping she turned her shining eyes away; which made me hasten all the more to come; and, even as she wished, I came to thee, and led thee from the presence of the beast, which robbed thee of the fair Mount's short approach.",
    "What is it, then? Why, why dost thou hold back? Why dost thou lodge such baseness in thy heart, and wherefore free and daring art thou not, since three so blessèd Ladies care for thee within the court of Heaven, and my words, too, give thee the promise of so much that's good?\"",
    "As little flowers by the chill of night bowed down and closed, when brightened by the sun, stand all erect and open on their stems;",
    "so likewise with my wearied strength did I; and such good daring coursed into my heart, that I began as one who had been freed:",
    "\"O piteous she who hastened to my help, and courteous thou, that didst at once obey the words of truth that she addressed to thee! Thou hast with such desire disposed my heart toward going on, by reason of thy words, that to my first intention I 've returned.",
    "Go on now, since we two have but one will; thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Teacher thou!\"",
    "I thus addressed him; then, when he had moved, I entered on the wild and arduous course.",
    "Through me one goes into the town of woe, through me one goes into eternal pain, through me among the people that are lost.",
    "Justice inspired my high exalted Maker; I was created by the Might divine, the highest Wisdom and the primal Love.",
    "Before me there was naught created, save eternal things, and I eternal last; all hope abandon, ye that enter here!",
    "These words of gloomy color I beheld inscribed upon the summit of a gate; whence I: \"Their meaning, Teacher, troubles me.\"",
    "And he to me, like one aware, replied: \"All fearfulness must here be left behind; all forms of cowardice must here be dead.",
    "We 've reached the place where, as I said to thee, thou 'lt see the sad folk who have lost the Good which is the object of the intellect.\" Then, after he had placed his hand in mine with cheerful face, whence I was comforted, he led me in among the hidden things.",
    "There sighs and wails and piercing cries of woe reverberated through the starless air; hence I, at first, shed tears of sympathy.",
    "Strange languages, and frightful forms of speech, words caused by pain, accents of anger, voices both loud and faint, and smiting hands withal, a mighty tumult made, which sweeps around forever in that timelessly dark air, as sand is wont, whene'er a whirlwind blows.",
    "And I, whose head was girt about with horror, said: \"Teacher, what is this I hear? What folk is this, that seems so overwhelmed with woe?\"",
    "And he to me: \"This wretched kind of life the miserable spirits lead of those who lived with neither infamy nor praise.",
    "Commingled are they with that worthless choir of Angels who did not rebel, nor yet were true to God, but sided with themselves.",
    "The heavens, in order not to be less fair, expelled them; nor doth nether Hell receive them, because the bad would get some glory thence.\"",
    "And I: \"What is it, Teacher, grieves them so, it causes them so loudly to lament?\". \"I 'll tell thee very briefly,\" he replied.",
    "\"These have no hope of death, and so low down is this unseeing life of theirs, that envious they are of every other destiny.",
    "The world allows no fame of them to live; Mercy and Justice hold them in contempt.",
    "Let us not talk of them; but look, and pass!\"",
    "And I, who gazed intently, saw a flag, which, whirling, moved so swiftly that to me contemptuous it appeared of all repose; and after it there came so long a line of people, that I never would have thought that death so great a number had undone.",
    "When some I 'd recognized, I saw and knew the shade of him who through his cowardice the great Refusal made.",
    "I understood immediately, and was assured that this the band of cowards was, who both to God displeasing are, and to His enemies.",
    "These wretched souls, who never were alive, were naked, and were sorely spurred to action by means of wasps and hornets that were there.",
    "The latter streaked their faces with their blood, which, after it had mingled with their tears, was at their feet sucked up by loathsome worms.",
    "When I had given myself to peering further, people I saw upon a great stream's bank; I therefore said: \"Now, Teacher, grant to me that I may know who these are, and what law makes them appear so eager to cross over, as in this dim light I perceive they are.\"",
    "And he to me: \"These things will be made clear to thee, as soon as on the dismal strand of Acheron we shall have stayed our steps.\" Thereat, with shame-suffused and downcast eyes, and fearing lest my talking might annoy him, up to the river I abstained from speech.",
    "Behold then, coming toward us in a boat, an agèd man, all white with ancient hair, who shouted: \"Woe to you, ye souls depraved! Give up all hope of ever seeing Heaven! I come to take you to the other shore, into eternal darkness, heat and cold.",
    "And thou that yonder art, a living soul, withdraw thee from those fellows that are dead.\" But when he saw that I did not withdraw, he said: \"By other roads and other ferries shalt thou attain a shore to pass across, not here; a lighter boat must carry thee.\"",
    "To him my Leader: \"Charon, be not vexed; thus is it yonder willed, where there is power to do whate'er is willed; so ask no more!\"",
    "Thereat were quieted the woolly cheeks of that old boatman of the murky swamp, who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.",
    "Those spirits, though, who nude and weary were, their color changed, and gnashed their teeth together, as soon as they had heard the cruel words.",
    "They kept blaspheming God, and their own parents, the human species, and the place, and time, and seed of their conception and their birth.",
    "Then each and all of them drew on together, weeping aloud, to that accursèd shore which waits for every man that fears not God.",
    "Charon, the demon, with his ember eyes makes beckoning signs to them, collects them all, and with his oar beats whoso takes his ease.",
    "Even as in autumn leaves detach themselves, now one and now another, till their branch sees all its stripped off clothing on the ground; so, one by one, the evil seed of Adam cast themselves down that river-bank at signals, as doth a bird to its recalling lure.",
    "Thus o'er the dusky waves they wend their way; and ere they land upon the other side, another crowd collects again on this.",
    "\"My son,\" the courteous Teacher said to me, \"all those that perish in the wrath of God from every country come together here; and eager are to pass across the stream, because Justice Divine so spurs them on, that what was fear is turned into desire.",
    "A good soul never goes across from hence; if Charon, therefore, findeth fault with thee, well canst thou now know what his words imply.\"",
    "The darkling plain, when this was ended, quaked so greatly, that the memory of my terror bathes me even now with sweat.",
    "The tear-stained ground gave forth a wind, whence flashed vermilion light which in me overcame all consciousness; and down I fell like one whom sleep o'ertakes.",
    "A heavy thunder-clap broke the deep sleep within my head, so that I roused myself, as would a person who is waked by force; and standing up erect, my rested eyes I moved around, and with a steady gaze I looked about to know where I might be.",
    "Truth is I found myself upon the verge of pain's abysmal valley, which collects the thunder-roll of everlasting woes.",
    "So dark it was, so deep and full of mist, that, howsoe'er I gazed into its depths, nothing at all did I discern therein.",
    "\"Into this blind world let us now descend!\" the Poet, who was death-like pale, began, \"I will be first, and thou shalt second be.\"",
    "And I, who of his color was aware, said: \"How am I to come, if thou take fright, who 'rt wont to be my comfort when afraid?\"",
    "\"The anguish of the people here below,\" he said to me, \"brings out upon my face the sympathy which thou dost take for fear.",
    "Since our long journey drives us, let us go!\" Thus he set forth, and thus he had me enter the first of circles girding the abyss.",
    "Therein, as far as one could judge by list'ning, there was no lamentation, saving sighs which caused a trembling in the eternal air; and this came from the grief devoid of torture felt by the throngs, which many were and great, of infants and of women and of men.",
    "To me then my good Teacher: \"Dost not ask what spirits these are whom thou seest here? Now I would have thee know, ere thou go further, that these sinned not; and though they merits have, 't is not enough, for they did not have baptism, the gateway of the creed believed by thee; and if before Christianity they lived, they did not with due worship honor God; and one of such as these am I myself.",
    "For such defects, and for no other guilt, we 're lost, and only hurt to this extent, that, in desire, we live deprived of hope.\"",
    "Great sorrow filled my heart on hearing this, because I knew of people of great worth, who in that Borderland suspended were.",
    "\"Tell me, my Teacher, tell me, thou my Lord,\" I then began, through wishing to be sure about the faith which conquers every error;",
    "\"came any ever, by his own deserts, or by another's, hence, who then was blest?\"",
    "And he, who understood my covert speech, replied: \"To this condition I was come but newly, when I saw a Mighty One come here, crowned with the sign of victory.",
    "From hence He drew the earliest parent's shade, and that of his son, Abel, that of Noah, and Moses the law-giver and obedient; Abram the patriarch, and David king, Israel, with both his father and his sons, and Rachel, too, for whom he did so much, and many others; and He made them blest; and I would have thee know that, earlier than these, there were no human spirits saved.\"",
    "Because he talked we ceased not moving on, but all the while were passing through the wood, the wood, I mean, of thickly crowded shades.",
    "Nor far this side of where I fell asleep had we yet gone, when I beheld a fire, which overcame a hemisphere of gloom.",
    "Somewhat away from it we were as yet, but not so far, but I could dimly see that honorable people held that place.",
    "\"O thou that honorest both art and science, who are these people that such honor have, that it divides them from the others' life?\"",
    "And he to me: \"The honorable fame, which speaks of them in thy live world above, in Heaven wins grace, which thus advances them.\"",
    "And hereupon a voice was heard by me: \"Do honor to the loftiest of poets! his shade, which had departed, now returns.\" And when the voice had ceased and was at rest, four mighty shades I saw approaching us; their looks were neither sorrowful nor glad.",
    "My kindly Teacher then began to say: \"Look at the one who comes with sword in hand before the three, as if their lord he were.",
    "Homer he is, the sovreign poet; Horace, the satirist, the one that cometh next; the third is Ovid, Lucan is the last.",
    "Since each of them in common shares with me the title which the voice of one proclaimed, they do me honor, and therein do well.\"",
    "Thus gathered I beheld the fair assembly of those the masters of the loftiest song, which soareth like an eagle o'er the rest.",
    "Then, having talked among themselves awhile, they turned around to me with signs of greeting; and, when he noticed this, my Teacher smiled.",
    "And even greater honor still they did me, for one of their own company they made me, so that amid such wisdom I was sixth.",
    "Thus on we went as far as to the light, talking of things whereof is silence here becoming, even as speech was, where we spoke.",
    "We reached a noble Castle's foot, seven times encircled by high walls, and all around defended by a lovely little stream.",
    "This last we crossed as if dry land it were; through seven gates with these sages I went in, and to a meadow of fresh grass we came.",
    "There people were with slow and serious eyes, and, in their looks, of great authority; they spoke but seldom and with gentle voice.",
    "We therefore to one side of it drew back into an open place so luminous and high, that each and all could be perceived.",
    "There on the green enamel opposite were shown to me the spirits of the great, for seeing whom I glory in myself.",
    "I saw Electra with companions many, of whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas, and Caesar armed, with shining falcon eyes.",
    "I saw Camilla with Penthesilea upon the other side, and King Latinus, who with Lavinia, his own daughter, sat.",
    "I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin out, Lucretia, Julia, Martia and Cornelia, and, all alone, I saw the Saladin.",
    "Then, having raised my brows a little higher, the Teacher I beheld of those that know, seated amid a philosophic group.",
    "They all look up to him, all honor him; there Socrates and Plato I beheld, who nearer than the rest are at his side; Democritus, who thinks the world chance-born, Diogenes, Anaxagoras and Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Zeno; of qualities I saw the good collector, Dioscorides I mean; Orpheus I saw, Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca; Euclid, the geometer, and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen, Averrhoès, who made the famous comment.",
    "I cannot speak of all of them in full, because my long theme drives me on so fast, that oft my words fall short of what I did.",
    "The sixfold band now dwindles down to two; my wise Guide leads me by a different path out of the calm into the trembling air; and to a place I come, where naught gives light.",
    "Thus from the first of circles I went down into the second, which surrounds less space, and all the greater pain, which goads to wailing.",
    "There Minos stands in horrid guise, and snarls; inside the entrance he examines sins, judges, and, as he girds himself, commits.",
    "I mean that when an ill-born soul appears before him, it confesses itself wholly; and thereupon that Connoisseur of sins perceives what place in Hell belongs to it, and girds him with his tail as many times, as are the grades he wishes it sent down.",
    "Before him there are always many standing; they go to judgment, each one in his turn; they speak and hear, and then are downward hurled.",
    "\"O thou that comest to the inn of woe,\" said Minos, giving up, on seeing me, the execution of so great a charge, \"see how thou enter, and in whom thou put thy trust; let not the gate-way's width deceive thee!\"",
    "To him my Leader: \"Why dost thou, too, cry?",
    "Hinder thou not his fate-ordained advance; thus is it yonder willed, where there is power to do whate'er is willed; so ask no more!\"",
    "And now the woeful sounds of actual pain begin to break upon mine ears; I now am come to where much wailing smiteth me.",
    "I reached a region silent of all light, which bellows as the sea doth in a storm, if lashed and beaten by opposing winds.",
    "The infernal hurricane, which never stops, carries the spirits onward with its sweep, and, as it whirls and smites them, gives them pain.",
    "Whene'er they come before the shattered rock, there lamentations, moans and shrieks are heard; there, cursing, they blaspheme the Power Divine.",
    "I understood that to this kind of pain are doomed those carnal sinners, who subject their reason to their sensual appetite.",
    "And as their wings bear starlings on their way, when days are cold, in full and wide-spread flocks; so doth that blast the evil spirits bear; this way and that, and up and down it leads them; nor only doth no hope of rest, but none of lesser suffering, ever comfort them.",
    "And even as cranes move on and sing their lays, forming the while a long line in the air; thus saw I coming, uttering cries of pain,",
    "shades borne along upon the aforesaid storm; I therefore said: \"Who, Teacher, are the people the gloomy air so cruelly chastises?\"",
    "\"The first of those of whom thou wouldst have news,\" the latter thereupon said unto me, \"was empress over lands of many tongues.",
    "To sexual vice so wholly was she given, that lust she rendered lawful in her laws, thus to remove the blame she had incurred.",
    "Semiramis she is, of whom one reads that she gave suck to Ninus, and became his wife; she held the land the Soldan rules.",
    "The next is she who killed herself through love, and to Sichaeus' ashes broke her faith; the lustful Cleopatra follows her.",
    "See Helen, for whose sake so long a time of guilt rolled by, and great Achilles see, who fought with love when at the end of life.",
    "Paris and Tristan see;\" and then he showed me, and pointed out by name, a thousand shades and more, whom love had from our life cut off.",
    "When I had heard my Leader speak the names of ladies and their knights of olden times, pity o'ercame me, and I almost swooned.",
    "\"Poet,\" I then began, \"I 'd gladly talk with those two yonder who together go, and seem to be so light upon the wind.\"",
    "\"Thou 'lt see thy chance when nearer us they are;\" said he, \"beseech them then by that same love which leadeth them along, and they will come.\"",
    "Soon as the wind toward us had bent their course.",
    "I cried: \"O toil-worn souls, come speak with us, so be it that One Else forbid it not!\"",
    "As doves, when called by their desire, come flying with raised and steady pinions through the air to their sweet nest, borne on by their own will; so from the band where Dido is they issued, advancing through the noisome air toward us, so strong with love the tone of my appeal.",
    "\"O thou benign and gracious living creature, that goest through the gloomy purple air to visit us, who stained the world blood-red; if friendly were the universal King, for thy peace would we pray to Him, since pity thou showest for this wretched woe of ours.",
    "Of whatsoever it may please you hear and speak, we will both hear and speak with you, while yet, as now it is, the wind is hushed.",
    "The town where I was born sits on the shore, whither the Po descends to be at peace together with the streams that follow him.",
    "Love, which soon seizes on a well-born heart, seized him for that fair body's sake, whereof I was deprived; and still the way offends me.",
    "Love, which absolves from loving none that 's loved, seized me so strongly for his love of me, that, as thou see'st, it doth not leave me yet.",
    "Love to a death in common led us on; Cain's ice awaiteth him who quenched our life.\" These words were wafted down to us from them.",
    "When I had heard those sorely troubled souls, I bowed my head, and long I held it low, until the Poet said: \"What thinkest thou?\" When I made answer I began: \"Alas! how many tender thoughts and what desire induced these souls to take the woeful step!\"",
    "I then turned back to them again and spoke, and I began: \"Thine agonies, Francesca, cause me to weep with grief and sympathy.",
    "But tell me: at the time of tender sighs, whereby and how did Love concede to you that ye should know each other's veiled desires?\"",
    "And she to me: \"There is no greater pain than to remember happy days in days of misery; and this thy Leader knows.",
    "But if to know the first root of our love so yearning a desire possesses thee, I 'll do as one who weepeth while he speaks.",
    "One day, for pastime merely, we were reading of Launcelot, and how love o'erpowered him; alone we were, and free from all misgiving.",
    "Oft did that reading cause our eyes to meet, and often take the color from our faces; and yet one passage only overcame us.",
    "When we had read of how the longed-for smile was kissed by such a lover, this one here, who nevermore shall be divided from me, trembling all over, kissed me on my mouth.",
    "A Gallehault the book, and he who wrote it! No further in it did we read that day.\"",
    "While one was saying this, the other spirit so sorely wept, that out of sympathy I swooned away as though about to die, and fell as falls a body that is dead.",
    "On my return to consciousness, which closed before the kindred couple's piteous case, which utterly confounded me with grief, new torments all around me I behold, and new tormented ones, where'er I move, where'er I turn, and wheresoe'er I gaze.",
    "In the third circle am I, that of rain eternal, cursèd, cold and burdensome; its measure and quality are never new.",
    "Coarse hail, and snow, and dirty-colored water through the dark air are ever pouring down; and foully smells the ground receiving them.",
    "A wild beast, Cerberus, uncouth and cruel, is barking with three throats, as would a dog, over the people that are there submerged.",
    "Red eyes he hath, a dark and greasy beard, a belly big, and talons on his hands; he claws the spirits, flays and quarters them.",
    "The rainfall causes them to howl like dogs; with one side they make shelter for the other; oft do the poor profaners turn about.",
    "When Cerberus, the mighty worm, perceived us, his mouths he opened, showing us his fangs; nor had he any limb that he kept still.",
    "My Leader then stretched out his opened palms, and took some earth, and with his fists well filled, he threw it down into the greedy throats.",
    "And like a dog that, barking, yearns for food, and, when he comes to bite it, is appeased, since only to devour it doth he strain and fight; even such became those filthy faces of demon Cerberus, who, thundering, stuns the spirits so, that they would fain be deaf.",
    "Over the shades the heavy rain beats down we then were passing, as our feet we set upon their unreal bodies which seem real.",
    "They each and all were lying on the ground, excepting one, which rose and sat upright, when it perceived us pass in front of it.",
    "\"O thou that through this Hell art being led,\" it said to me, \"recall me, if thou canst; for thou, before I unmade was, wast made.\"",
    "And I to it: \"The anguish thou art in perchance withdraws thee from my memory so, it doth not seem that thee I ever saw.",
    "But tell me who thou art, that in so painful a place art set, and to such punishment, that none, though greater, so repulsive is.\"",
    "And he to me: \"Thy town, which is so full of envy that the bag o'erflows already, owned me when I was in the peaceful life.",
    "Ciacco, you townsmen used to call me then; for my injurious fault of gluttony I 'm broken, as thou seest, by the rain; nor yet am I, sad soul, the only one, for all these here are subject, for like fault, unto like pain.\" Thereat he spoke no more.",
    "\"Thy trouble, Ciacco,\" I replied to him, \"so burdens me that it invites my tears; but tell me, if thou canst, to what will come the citizens of our divided town; if any one therein is just; and tell me the reason why such discord hath assailed her.\"",
    "And he to me then: \"After struggling long they 'll come to bloodshed, and the boorish party will drive the other out with much offence.",
    "Then, afterward, the latter needs must fall within three suns, and the other party rise, by help of one who now is o the fence.' A long time will it hold its forehead up, keeping the other under grievous weights, howe'er it weep therefor, and be ashamed.",
    "Two men are just, but are not heeded there; the three sparks that have set men's hearts on fire, are overweening pride, envy and greed.\" Herewith he closed his tear-inspiring speech.",
    "And I to him: \"I 'd have thee teach me still, and grant the favor of some further talk.",
    "Farinàta and Tegghiàio, who so worthy were, Jàcopo Rusticùcci, Arrigo and Mosca, and the others who were set on doing good, tell me where these are, and let me know of them; for great desire constraineth me to learn if Heaven now sweeten, or Hell poison them.\"",
    "And he: \"Among the blackest souls are these; a different fault weighs toward the bottom each; if thou descend so far, thou mayst behold them.",
    "But when in the sweet world thou art again, recall me, prithee, unto others' minds; I tell no more, nor further answer thee.\"",
    "His fixed eyes thereupon he turned askance; a while he looked at me, then bowed his head, and fell therewith among the other blind.",
    "Then said my Leader: \"He 'll not wake again on this side of the angel-trumpet's sound.",
    "What time the hostile Podestà shall come, each soul will find again its dismal tomb, each will take on again its flesh and shape, and hear what through eternity resounds.\"",
    "We thus passed through with slowly moving steps the filthy mixture of the shades and rain, talking a little of the future life;",
    "because of which I said: \"These torments, Teacher, after the Final Sentence will they grow, or less become, or burn the same as now.\"",
    "And he to me: \"Return thou to thy science, which holdeth that the more a thing is perfect, so much the more it feels of weal or woe.",
    "Although this cursèd folk shall nevermore arrive at true perfection, it expects to be more perfect after, than before.\"",
    "As in a circle, round that road we went, speaking at greater length than I repeat, and came unto a place where one descends; there found we Plutus, the great enemy.",
    "\"Papè Satàn, papè Satàn, alèppë!\" thus Plutus with his clucking voice began; that noble Sage, then, who knew everything, said, to encourage me: \"Let not thy fear distress thee, for, whatever power he have, he 'll not prevent our going down this rock.\"",
    "Then to those swollen lips he turned around, and said: \"Be silent, thou accursèd wolf; with thine own rage consume thyself within! Not causeless is our going to the bottom; there is it willed on high, where Michael wrought vengeance upon the arrogant rebellion.\"",
    "As sails, when swollen by the wind, fall down entangled, when the mast breaks; even so, down to the ground the cruel monster fell.",
    "Into the fourth ditch we descended thus, advancing further o'er the woeful edge, which bags all evil in the universe.",
    "Justice of God, alas! who heapeth up the many unheard of toils and pains I saw, and wherefore doth our sin torment us so?",
    "As yonder o'er Charybdis doth the sea, which breaks against the one it runs to meet, so must the people dance a ring-dance here.",
    "I here saw folk, more numerous than elsewhere, on one side and the other, with great howls rolling big weights around by strength of chest; they struck against each other; then, right there each turned, and rolling back his weight, cried out: \"Why keepest thou?\" and \"Wherefore throw away?\" They circled thus around the gloomy ring on either hand unto the point opposed, still shouting each to each their vile refrain; then each turned back, when through his own half-ring he had attained the other butting place.",
    "And I, whose heart was well nigh broken, said: \"Now, Teacher, show me who these people are, and tell me whether all these tonsured ones upon our left ecclesiastics were.\"",
    "And he replied to me: \"They each and all were in their first life so squint-eyed in mind, that they with measure used no money there.",
    "Clearly enough their voices bark it forth, whene'er they reach the two points of the ring, where difference in fault unmateth them.",
    "These churchmen were, who have no hairy covering upon their heads, and Popes and Cardinals, among whom avarice works its mastery.\"",
    "And I to him: \"Among such men as these I surely, Teacher, ought to recognize a few, who by these sins polluted were.\"",
    "And he to me: \"Thou shapest a vain thought; the undiscerning life which made them foul, now to all recognition makes them dark.",
    "To these two shocks they 'll come eternally; these from the sepulchre will rise again close-fisted; these, shorn of their very hair.",
    "Ill-giving and ill-keeping took from them the lovely world, and set them at this fray; to qualify it I 'll not use fair words.",
    "Now canst thou, son, behold the short-lived cheat of riches that are put in Fortune's care, and for whose sake the human race contends; for, all the gold there is beneath the moon, and all that was there once, could not avail to make one of these weary spirits rest.\"",
    "\"Teacher,\" said I to him, \"now tell me further: what is this Fortune thou dost touch upon, which hath the world's good things thus in her claws?\"",
    "\"O foolish creatures,\" said he then to me.",
    "\"how great the ignorance which hurteth you! I 'd have thee swallow now my thought of her.",
    "The One whose knowledge everything transcends, so made the heavens, and so gave guides to them, that every part on every other shines,",
    "thus equally distributing the light; likewise for worldly splendours He ordained a general minister and guide, to change, from time to time, the vain goods of the world from race to race, from one blood to another, past all resistance by the minds of men; wherefore, one people governs, and the other declines in power, according to her judgment, which hidden is, as in the grass a snake.",
    "Your knowledge is not able to resist her; foreseeing, she decides, and carries on her government, as theirs the other gods.",
    "Her permutations have no truce at all; necessity compels her to be swift; hence oft it happens that a change occurs.",
    "This is the one who is so often cursed even by those who ought to give her praise, yet give her blame amiss, and ill repute.",
    "But she is blest, and gives no heed to that; among the other primal creatures glad, she turns her sphere, and blest enjoys herself.",
    "But now to woe more piteous let 's descend; now falls each star that rose when I set out, and one is here forbidden too long a stay.\"",
    "We crossed the circle to the other bank over a bubbling stream, that poureth down along a ditch which from it takes its shape.",
    "Than purple-black much darker was its water; and we, accompanying its dusky waves, went down and entered on an uncouth path.",
    "A swamp it forms which hath the name of Styx, this dismal little brook, when it hath reached the bottom of the grey, malignant slopes.",
    "And I, who was intensely gazing there, saw muddy people in that slimy marsh, all naked, and with anger in their looks.",
    "They struck each other, not with hands alone, but with their heads and chests, and with their feet, and rent each other piecemeal with their teeth.",
    "Said the good Teacher: \"Son, thou seest now the souls of those whom anger overcame; nay, more, I 'd have thee certainly believe that 'neath the water there are folk who sigh, and make this water bubble at its surface, as, wheresoe'er it turn, thine eye reveals.",
    "Stuck in the slime, they say: \"Sullen we were in the sweet air that 's gladdened by the sun, bearing within us fumes of surliness; we now are sullen in the swamp's black mire.\" This hymn they gurgle down inside their throats, because they cannot utter it with perfect speech.",
    "And so we circled round the filthy fen a great arc 'tween the dry bank and the marsh, our eyes intent on those that swallow mud; and to a tower's foot we came at last.",
    "I say, continuing, that long before we ever reached the lofty tower's foot, our eyes had upward toward its summit turned, because of two small flames we there saw placed, and of another answering from so far, that hardly could mine eyesight make it out.",
    "Then to all wisdom's Sea I turned around, and said: \"What sayeth this? and what replies that other fire? and who are they that made it?\"",
    "And he to me: \"Upon the filthy waves thou canst already see what is expected, unless the marsh's fog conceal it from thee.\"",
    "Bowstring ne'er shot an arrow from itself, that sped away so swiftly through the air, as I beheld a slender little boat come toward us through the water thereupon, under the guidance of a single boatman, who shouted: \"Thou art caught now, wicked soul!\"",
    "\"O Phlegyas, Phlegyas,\" said my Master then, \"this time thou criest out in vain! No longer shalt thou have us, than while we cross the swamp.\"",
    "Like one who listens to a great deceit practiced upon him, and who then resents it, so Phlegyas in his stifled wrath became.",
    "My Leader then went down into the boat, and had me enter after him; and only when I was in it did it laden seem.",
    "Soon as my Leader and I were in the boat, the ancient prow goes on its way, and cuts more water than with others is its wont.",
    "While we were speeding through the stagnant trench, one stood before me filled with mud, and said: \"Now who art thou, that comest ere thy time?\"",
    "And I to him: \"Even though I come, I stay not; but who art thou, that art become so foul?\" He answered: \"As thou see'st, I 'm one who weeps.\"",
    "Then I to him: \"In sorrow and in grief mayst thou, accursèd spirit, here remain, for thee I know, all filthy though thou be!\"",
    "Then toward the boat he stretched out both his hands; my wary Teacher, therefore, thrust him off, saying: \"Away there with the other dogs!\" And with his arms he then embraced my neck, and kissed my face, and said: \"Blessèd be she who pregnant was with thee, indignant soul! He was a haughty person in the world; nor is there any goodness which adorns his memory; hence his shade is furious here.",
    "How many now up yonder think themselves great kings, who here shall be like pigs in mire, leaving behind them horrible contempt!\"",
    "And I said: \"Teacher, I 'd be greatly pleased to see him get a ducking in this broth, before we issue from the marshy lake.\"",
    "And he to me: \"Thou shalt be satisfied before the shore reveal itself to thee; 't is meet that thou enjoy a wish like that.\"",
    "Soon after this I saw the muddy people making such havoc of him, that therefor I still give praise and render thanks to God.",
    "They all were shouting: \"At Filippo Argenti!\" the spirit of the wrathful Florentine turning, meanwhile, his teeth against himself.",
    "We left him there; of him I therefore tell no more; but on mine ears there smote a wail, hence I, intent ahead, unbar mine eyes.",
    "The kindly Teacher said: \"Now, son, at last the town, whose name is Dis, is drawing near with all its host of burdened citizens.\"",
    "And I said: \"Teacher, clearly I behold its mosques already in that valley there, vermilion, as if issuing out of fire.\"",
    "And he to me: \"The eternal fire within which keeps them burning, maketh them look red, as thou perceivest in this nether Hell.\"",
    "Thereat we came inside the trenches deep, which fortify that region comfortless; to me its walls appeared to be of iron.",
    "Not without going first a long way round, we came to where the boatman cried aloud to us: \"Get out, for here the entrance is!\"",
    "More than a thousand o'er the gates I saw of those that from the heavens had rained, who, vexed, were saying: \"Who is he, that, without death, is going through the kingdom of the dead?\" And my wise Teacher thereupon made signs of wishing to have private talk with them.",
    "Their great disdain they somewhat checked, and said: \"Come thou alone, and let him go his way, who with such daring entered this domain.",
    "Let him retrace alone his foolish road, and try it, if he can; for thou shalt here remain, that him so dark a land didst show.\"",
    "Think, Reader, whether I lost heart on hearing those cursèd words; for I did not believe that I should e'er return on earth again.",
    "\"O my dear Leader, who hast made me safe more than seven times, and extricated me from serious dangers which I had to face, forsake me not,\" said I, \"when so undone! If further progress be denied to us, let us at once retrace our steps together.\"",
    "That Lord then, who had brought me thither, said: \"Be not afraid; for none can take from us our passage, since by such an One 't is given! But thou, await me here, and with good hope nourish and comfort thou thy weary soul, for I 'll not leave thee in the nether world.\"",
    "Thus goes his way, and there abandons me, my tender Father, and I in doubt remain; for Yes and No contend within my head.",
    "I could not hear what he proposed to them; but with them there he did not long remain, for each in rivalry ran back within.",
    "They closed the gates, those enemies of ours, right in my Master's face, who stayed outside, and walking with slow steps returned to me.",
    "His eyes were downcast, and his eyebrows shorn of all self-trust, and as he sighed he said: \"Who has forbidden me the homes of pain?\"",
    "\"Though I get angry, be not thou dismayed,\" he said to me, \"for I shall win the fight, whate'er defensive stir be made within.",
    "This insolence of theirs is nothing new, for at a gateway less concealed than this they used it once, which still is lockless found.",
    "Death's scroll thou sawest over it; and now this side of it One such descends the slope, crossing the rings unguided, that through him the city will be opened unto us.\"",
    "The color cowardice brought out on me, who saw my Leader coming back, the sooner repressed in him his unaccustomed hue.",
    "He stopped attentive like a man who listens; because his eyesight could not lead him far through the dark air, and through the heavy fog.",
    "\"Yet we must win the battle,\" he began, \"unless ...",
    "One such did offer us herself! Oh, how I long for some one to arrive!\"",
    "I well perceived how, when he overlaid what he began to say by what came after, that these were words that differed from the first.",
    "But none the less his language gave me fear, because I lent to his unfinished phrase a meaning worse, perhaps, than he intended.",
    "\"Into this bottom of the dismal shell doth any of that first grade e'er descend, whose only penalty is hope cut off?\"",
    "I asked this question. He replied to me: \"It seldom comes to pass that one of us performs the journey whereupon I go.",
    "'T is true that I was conjured once before down here by magic of that wild Erachtho, who used to call shades back into their bodies.",
    "My flesh had hardly been made bare of me, when me she forced to enter yonder wall, and thence withdraw a soul from Judas' ring.",
    "That is the lowest and the darkest place, and from the heaven that turns all things most distant; well do I know the road; so be at rest! This marsh, from which the mighty stench exhales, girdles the woeful city round about, which without wrath we cannot enter now.\"",
    "And more he said, but I recall it not, because mine eye had made me wholly heed the glowing summit of the lofty tower, where three infernal Furies stained with blood had suddenly uprisen all at once, having the members and the mien of women, and girt with water-snakes of brightest green; for hair they had small serpents and horned snakes, wherewith their frightful temples were entwined.",
    "And he, who well the handmaids of the Queen of everlasting lamentation knew, said unto me: \"Behold the fierce Eranyes! This is Megaera here upon the left; Alecto, she who weepeth on the right; Tisaphonë's between.\" Thereat he ceased.",
    "Each with her nails was tearing at her breast; they smote them with their hands, and cried so loud, that to the Poet I drew close in dread.",
    "\"Now let Medusa come! We 'll turn him thus to stone!\" they all cried out, as down they looked; \"wrong were we not to punish Theseus' raid.\"",
    "\"Turn back, and close thine eyes, for should the Gorgon reveal itself, and thou behold the face, there 'd be no more returning up above.\" The Teacher thus: and turning me himself, on my hands he did not so far rely, as not to close mine eyes with his as well.",
    "O ye in whom intelligence is sound, heed carefully the teaching which lies hidden beneath the veil of my mysterious lines!",
    "There now was coming o'er the turbid waves the uproar of a dread-inspiring sound, because of which both shores were all aquake, a noise like nothing other than a wind, impetuous through opposing heats, which smites a forest, and without the least restraint shatters, lays low, and carries off its boughs; dust-laden it goes proudly on its way, and makes wild animals and shepherds flee.",
    "He freed mine eyes, and said: \"Direct thou now thy keenest vision o'er that ancient scum, to where that reeking smoke is most intense.\"",
    "As frogs before the hostile water-snake scatter in all directions through the water, till each is squatting huddled on the shore; more than a thousand ruined souls I saw, who thus from one were fleeing, who on foot, but with dry feet, was passing over Styx.",
    "That dense air he kept moving from his face by often passing his left hand before him, and only with that trouble weary seemed.",
    "I well perceived he was a Messenger from Heaven, and to my Teacher turned; with signs he warned me to keep still, and bow before him.",
    "Ah, how disdainful did he seem to me! He reached the gate, and with a little wand he opened it, for hindrance had he none.",
    "\"O people thrust from Heaven and held in scorn,\" upon the horrid threshold he began, \"whence dwells in you this overweening pride? Why is it that ye kick against the Will, from which its end can never be cut off, and which hath more than once increased your pain? Of what avail to butt against the Fates? Your Cerberus, if ye remember well, still sports for this a hairless chin and neck.\"",
    "He then returned along the filthy road, nor did he say a word to us; but looked like one whom other cares constrain and gnaw,",
    "than that of him who in his presence is; then we with full assurance toward the town, after those holy words, addressed our steps.",
    "We entered it without the least contention; and I, who longed to look about and see the state of those whom such a fortress holds, when I was in it, cast mine eyes around, and see on every side an ample plain, with anguish and with awful torture filled.",
    "Even as at Arles, where marshy turns the Rhone, or as at Pola near Quarnaro's gulf, which bounds Italia, and her border bathes, the sepulchres make all the ground uneven; so likewise did they here on every side, save that their nature was more bitter here; for flames were spread about within the tombs, whereby they glowed with such intensity, that no art needeth greater heat for iron.",
    "The lids of all of them were raised, and wails so woeful issued thence, that of a truth they seemed the wails of wretched, tortured men.",
    "\"Teacher, what sort of people are those there,\" said I, \"who, buried in those arc-like tombs, make themselves heard by means of woeful sighs?\"",
    "\"Arch-heretics are with their followers here\" said he, \"of every sect, and far more laden than thou believest are the sepulchers.",
    "Here like with like is buried, and more hot and less so are the monuments.\" Thereat, when he had turned him to the right, we passed between the woes and lofty bastioned walls.",
    "Now wends his way along a narrow path, between the torments and the city's wall, my Teacher and, behind his shoulders, I.",
    "\"O lofty Virtue,\" I began, \"that leadst me around the impious circles at thy pleasure, converse with me and satisfy my wishes.",
    "The people that are lying in the tombs, could they be seen? For all the lids are raised, it seems, and there is no one keeping guard.\"",
    "And he to me: \"They all will be locked in, when from Jehoshaphat they here return together with the bodies they have left above.",
    "On this side have their burial-place with Epicurus all his followers, who claim that with the body dies the soul.",
    "To the request, however, which thou makest thou 'lt soon receive a due reply in here, as also to the wish thou keepest from me.\"",
    "And I: \"Good Leader, I but keep my heart concealed from thee, in order to speak little; nor hast thou only now thereto disposed me.\"",
    "\"O Tuscan, thou that through the town of fire dost go alive with such respectful speech, in this place be thou pleased to stay thy steps.",
    "Thy very language makes thee manifest a native of that noble fatherland, to which I was, perhaps, too great a bane.\"",
    "All of a sudden issued forth these words from one of those ark-tombs; hence I, in fear, a little closer to my Leader drew.",
    "And he said: \"Turn around; what doest thou? See Farinata who has risen there; thou 'lt see him wholly from his girdle up.\"",
    "Already had I fixed mine eyes on his; and he was standing up with chest and head erect, as if he had great scorn for Hell.",
    "My Leader then with bold and ready hands pushed me between the sepulchers toward him, saying: \"Now let thy words be frank and clear.\"",
    "When I was 'neath his tomb, he looked at me awhile, and then, as though disdainfully, he asked of me: \"Who were thine ancestors?\"",
    "And I, who was desirous to obey, hid it not from him, but revealed it all; whereat he slightly raised his brows, and said: \"So bitterly were they opposed to me, and to mine ancestors, and to my party, that I on two occasions scattered them.\"",
    "\"If they were driven out,\" I answered him, \"from all directions they returned both times; your people, though, have not well learned that art.\"",
    "A shade then at the tomb's uncovered mouth rose at his side as far up as his chin; I think that he had risen upon his knees.",
    "Round me he looked, as if he wished to see whether some other one were with me there; but when his doubt had wholly spent itself, weeping he said: \"If thou through this blind prison dost go by reason of highmindedness, where is my son? and why is he not with thee?\"",
    "And I to him: \"I come not by myself; he who is waiting yonder leads me here, one whom, perhaps, your Guido held in scorn.\" The nature of his torment and his words had read this person's name to me already; on this account was my reply so full.",
    "Then of a sudden standing up, he cried: \"What saidst thou? Held? Is he not still alive? Doth not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?\" When he perceived the short delay I made before replying, down upon his back he fell, nor outside showed himself again.",
    "The other one, meanwhile, the great-souled man, at whose request I stopped, changed not his looks, nor did he move his neck or turn his side.",
    "And \"If,\" continuing his previous words, he said: \"if they have badly learned that art, far more doth that torment me than this bed.",
    "And yet that Lady's face who ruleth here shall not be lighted fifty times again, ere thou shalt know how heavy that art is.",
    "And so mayst thou return to the sweet world, pray tell me why so pitiless toward mine that people is in every law of theirs?\"",
    "Whence I to him: \"The havoc and great slaughter which caused the Arbia to be colored red, occasion such petitions in our church.\"",
    "When, sighing, he had tossed his head, he said: \"In this thing I was not alone, nor surely had I, without due cause, moved with the rest; but I was yonder, where assent was given by every one to do away with Florence, the only one to openly defend her.\"",
    "\"So may your seed eventually repose,\" I begged of him, \"untie for me, I pray, the knot which has perplexed my thinking here.",
    "It seems, if well I hear, that ye behold beforehand that which time brings with itself, while in the present ye do otherwise.\"",
    "\"We see,\" he said, \"like one whose sight is poor, things that are far from us; to that extent the Highest Leader shines upon us still.",
    "When they approach, or are, our intellect is wholly vain, and we, if others bring no news, know nothing of your human state.",
    "Hence thou canst understand that wholly dead will be our knowledge from that moment on, when closed shall be the gateway of the future.\"",
    "Thereat, for I was grieved at my mistake, I said: \"You 'll therefore tell that fallen man his son is dwelling with the living still; and if in answering I was mute just now, cause him to know it was because my thoughts were struggling with the problem you have solved.\"",
    "And now my Teacher was recalling me; with greater haste I therefore begged the spirit that he would tell me who was with him there.",
    "He said: \"With o'er a thousand here I lie; the second Frederick and the Cardinal are here within; I speak not of the rest.\"",
    "He thereupon concealed himself; and I, those words recalling which seemed hostile to me, back toward the ancient Poet turned my steps.",
    "The latter moved; and then, as on we went, he said to me: \"Why art thou so perplexed?\" And him in what he asked I satisfied.",
    "\"Then let thy mind preserve,\" that Sage enjoined, \"what thou hast heard against thyself; pay now attention here!\" His finger then he raised.",
    "\"When in the sweet ray's presence thou shalt be of Her whose lovely eyes see everything, from her thou 'lt know the journey of thy life.\"",
    "Thereafter to the left he turned his feet; we left the wall, and toward the middle went along a path which to a valley leads, which even up there unpleasant made its stench.",
    "Upon the utmost verge of a high bank, formed in a circle by great broken rocks, we came upon a still more cruel pack; and there, by reason of the horrible excess of stench the deep abyss exhales, for shelter we withdrew behind the lid of a large tomb, whereon I saw a scroll which said: \"Pope Anastasius I contain, whom out of the right way Photinus drew.\"",
    "\"Our going down from here must be delayed, so that our sense may first get used a little to this foul blast; we shall not mind it then.\"",
    "The Teacher thus; and I: \"Find thou therefor some compensation, lest our time be lost.\" And he to me: \"See how I think of this.\"",
    "\"My son, within these rocks,\" he then began, \"are three small circles which, from grade to grade, are similar to those thou leavest now.",
    "Full of accursèd spirits are they all; but that hereafter sight alone suffice thee, hear how, and wherefore they are packed together.",
    "Of all wrong-doing which in Heaven wins hate injustice is the end, and each such end aggrieves by either violence or fraud.",
    "But whereas fraud is man's peculiar evil, God hates it most; therefore the fraudulent are down below, and greater pain assails them.",
    "All the first circle holds the violent; but since against three persons force is used, its shape divides it into three great rings.",
    "Both against God, one's neighbor, and one 's self may force be used; against themselves, I mean, and what is theirs, as clearly shown thou 'lt hear.",
    "By force both death and painful wounds are given one 's neighbor, and thereby his property is ruined, burned, and by extortions robbed; the first ring, hence, torments in separate troops all homicides and those that smite with malice, spoilers of property and highway robbers.",
    "Upon oneself may one lay violent hands, and on one 's goods; hence in the second ring must needs repentant be without avail whoever of your world deprives himself, gambles away and dissipates his means, and weepeth there where he should joyful be.",
    "'Gainst God may force be used, by wittingly denying that He is, by blasphemy, and by disprizing Nature and His Goodness;",
    "and therefore with its mark the lesser ring sealeth both Sodom and Cahors, and him who, speaking from his heart, despises God.",
    "And fraud, whereby all consciences are bitten, one may employ against a man who trusts him, and 'gainst a man who storeth up no trust.",
    "This latter kind of fraud would seem to kill only the bond of love which Nature makes; hence in the second circle make their nest hypocrisy, and flatteries, and workers of magic, coining, theft and simony, panders and grafters, and such filth as these.",
    "In the other way forgotten is the love which Nature makes, and that which afterward is joined thereto, whence special trust is born; hence in the smallest ring, where the universe its center hath, and on which Dis is seated, whoe'er betrays is spent eternally.\"",
    "\"Teacher,\" said I, \"thine argument proceeds most lucidly, and full well classifies this deep abyss and those that people it.",
    "But tell me now: those of the muddy marsh, those whom the wind drives, those the rain beats down, and those that with such keen tongues meet each other, why are n't they punished in the red-hot town, if God be angry with them? and, if not, why are they tortured in those several ways?\"",
    "And he to me: \"Why doth thine intellect wander so far from that which is its wont, or doth thy mind intently gaze elsewhere? Hast thou no recollection of the words with which thine Ethics treats extensively the dispositions three which Heaven rejects, Incontinence, and Malice, and insane Bestiality, and how Incontinence offends God least, and hence receives least blame? If thou consider this opinion well, and then remember who those are above, that outside undergo their punishment, well shalt thou see why from these wretches here they 're set apart, and why less wrathfully Vengeance Divine is hammering on them there.\"",
    "\"O Sun that healest every troubled sight, thou so contentest me when answering questions, that doubt, no less than knowledge, pleases me.",
    "Return a little further back,\" said I, \"to where thou sayest usury offends Goodness Divine, and loose the tangled knot.\"",
    "\"Philosophy\" said he to me, \"points out to him that understandeth it, and not in one part only, that Nature takes her course from the Intellect Divine, and from its Art; and if thou note thy Physics carefully, after not many pages shalt thou find",
    "that your art follows that, as best it can, as the disciple him who teaches; hence, your art is grandchild, as it were, to God.",
    "From these two things, if thou recall to mind the first of Genesis, must people needs obtain their livelihood, and progress make.",
    "And as the usurer takes another course, Nature both in herself and in her follower he scorneth, since in something else he trusts.",
    "But follow me now, for I please to go; because the Fishes o'er the horizon quiver, and wholly over Caurus lies the Wain, and one descends the bank much further on.\"",
    "The place, where to descend the bank we came, was Alp-like, and, through what was also there, such that all eyes would be repelled by it.",
    "As is that downfall on the hither side of Trent, which sidewise smote the Àdige, through earthquake or through failure of support; since from the mountain's summit, whence it moved down to the plain, the rock is shattered so, that it would yield a path for one above; even such was the descent of that ravine; and on the border of the broken bank was stretched at length the Infamy of Crete, who in the seeming heifer was conceived; and when he saw us there he bit himself, like one whom inward anger overcomes.",
    "In his direction then my Sage cried out: \"Dost thou, perhaps, think Athens' duke is here, who gave thee death when in the world above? Begone, thou beast! for this man cometh not taught by thy sister, but is going by, in order to behold your punishments.\"",
    "As doth a bull, who from his leash breaks free the moment he receives the mortal blow, and cannot walk, but plunges here and there; so doing I beheld the Minotaur; and he, aware, cried out: \"Run to the pass! 't is well that, while he rages, thou descend.\"",
    "Thereat we made our way adown that heap of fallen rocks, which often 'neath my feet were moved, because of their unwonted load.",
    "I went along in thought; and he: \"Perchance thou thinkest of this landslide, which is guarded by that beast's anger which I quenched just now.",
    "Now I would have thee know that, when down here to nether Hell I came, that other time, this mass of rock had not yet fallen down.",
    "But certainly, if I remember well, not long ere He arrived, who carried off from Dis the highest circle's mighty prey, on every side the deep and foul abyss so trembled that I thought the universe had felt the love, whereby, as some believe, the world to Chaos hath been oft reduced; and at that moment this old mass of rock was thus, both here and elsewhere, overthrown.",
    "But turn thine eyes down yonder now; for lo, the stream of blood is drawing near to us, wherein boils who by violence harms others.\"",
    "O blind cupidity, O foolish wrath, that so dost in our short life goad us on, and after, in the eternal, steep us thus!",
    "I saw a wide moat curving in an arc, and such that it embraces all the plain, according as my Escort had informed me; and in a file, between it and the bank, Centaurs were running by, with arrows armed, as in the world it was their wont to hunt.",
    "On seeing us descend, they all stopped short, and three of them detached them from the troop, with bows and arrows they had chosen first.",
    "And one cried from afar: \"Ye that descend the slope, to what pain are ye coming? Tell it from there, or else I draw my bow.\"",
    "My Teacher said: \"Our answer will we give to Chiron yonder, when we reach his side; thus ever to thy harm was thy will rash.\"",
    "He touched me then, and said: \"That one is Nessus, who died for lovely Dejanira's sake, and who himself wrought vengeance for himself; the middle one, who gazes at his breast, is that great Chiron who brought up Achilles; the other, Pholus, who so wrathful was.",
    "They go by thousands round about the moat, shooting each soul that from the blood emerges further than its own sin allotted it.\"",
    "To those swift-footed beasts we then drew near; Chiron an arrow took, and with its notch backward upon his jaws he pushed his beard.",
    "When he had thus uncovered his great mouth, he said unto his mates: \"Are ye aware that he who comes behind moves what he touches? Yet dead men's feet are not thus wont to do.\"",
    "And my good Leader, who now reached his breast, where the two natures are together joined, replied: \"He lives indeed, and thus alone must I needs show to him the dark abyss; necessity is leading him, not pleasure.",
    "One who withdrew from singing praise to God, gave me this new commission; he is not a highwayman, nor I a robber's soul.",
    "But by the Power, through whom I move my steps along so wild a road, bestow on us one of thy troop, at whose side we may be, and who may show us where one fords, and carry this man upon his back, for he is not a spirit who can travel through the air.\"",
    "Upon his right breast Chiron turned, and said to Nessus: \"Turn around, and guide them thus, and if another troop should meet you, cause it to stand aside.\" Then we with this safe escort skirted the edge of that red, boiling stream, wherein the boiled were crying out aloud.",
    "I saw some people in it to their brows.",
    "\"These tyrants are,\" the mighty Centaur said, \"who took to bloodshed and to plundering.",
    "Here tears are shed because of heartless wrongs; here Alexander is, and who for years grieved Sicily, fierce Dionysius.",
    "The brow which hath so black a head of hair, is Azzolino; the other which is blond, Obizzo of Este, who in truth was quenched up in the world by his un-natural son.\" I turned then toward the Poet, but he said: \"Be he now first to thee, and second I.\"",
    "A little further on the Centaur stopped over some people who, it seemed, emerged out of that boiling river from their necks.",
    "On one side there a lonely shade he showed us, and said: \"He yonder in God's bosom pierced the heart, which still is honored on the Thames.\"",
    "Then people I beheld who from the stream held out their heads, and even all their chest; and many did I recognize of these.",
    "Thus shallower and shallower became that blood, until it only cooked their feet; here was the place for us to ford the ditch.",
    "\"Even as thou seest that the boiling stream grows shallow more and more on this side here,\" the Centaur said, \"I wish thee to believe",
    "that on this other side its bottom sinks increasingly, until it joins the place where it behooveth tyranny to groan.",
    "Justice Divine is over here tormenting that Attila who was a scourge on earth, Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and forever milks the tears, which with the boiling it unlocks, from Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo, who on the highroads waged so great a war.\"",
    "He then turned back, and crossed the ford again.",
    "Not yet had Nessus reached the other side, when we had set our steps within a wood, which was not marked by any path whatever.",
    "No green leaves there, but leaves of gloomy hue; no smooth and straight, but gnarled and twisted, twigs; nor was there any fruit, but poison-thorns.",
    "No thickets rough and dense as these are owned by those wild beasts, that hate the tilled estates that lie between the Cécina and Corneto.",
    "Herein those ugly Harpies make their nest, who drove the Trojans from the Strophades, with gloomy prophecies of future loss.",
    "Wide wings they have, and human necks and faces; their feet are clawed, and feathered their great bellies; they utter wailings on the uncouth trees.",
    "My kindly Teacher then began to say: \"Before thou enter any further, know that in the second ring thou art, and wilt be, until thou reach the horrid plain of sand; hence look around thee well, and things thou 'lt see, that from my words would take away belief.\"",
    "Moans I heard uttered upon every side, but saw no person who might make them there; hence, utterly confused, I checked my steps.",
    "I think he thought I thought that all those voices were uttered from among those thorny trunks by people hiding there on our account.",
    "The Teacher therefore said: \"If thou break off a little twig from any of these trees, the thoughts thou hast will all be proven false.\"",
    "I then stretched out my hand a little way, and from a sturdy thorn-tree plucked a twig, whereat its trunk cried out: \"Why dost thou rend me?\" Then, after growing dark with blood, its cry began again: \"Why dost thou break me off? Hast thou no spirit of compassion in thee? Men were we once, and now are stocks become; thy hand ought surely to have had more pity, even if the souls of serpents we had been.\"",
    "As from a fresh, green log, that at one end is being burned, and at the other drips and makes a hissing with the escaping air; so from the broken twig together issued both words and blood; I therefore dropped the end, and stood dumbfounded, like a man who fears.",
    "\"Had he before been able to believe, O wounded soul,\" replied my Sage to him, \"what in my verses only he has seen,",
    "he had not set his hand on thee; whereas the thing's incredibility has made me lead him to do what I myself regret.",
    "But tell him who thou wast, that he, by way of compensation, may refresh thy fame up in the world, where he can still return.\"",
    "The trunk: \"With sweet words thou dost so entice me, that I can not keep still; be not annoyed, if I am tempted to a little talk.",
    "I am the man who once held both the keys of Frederick's heart, and he who turned them round so gently, locking and unlocking it, that most men from his secrets I withheld; so faithful was I to my glorious charge, that for its sake I lost both sleep and strength.",
    "The courtesan who never turned away her harlot eyes from Caesar's dwelling-place, a common form of death and vice of courts, 'gainst me inflamed the minds of every one; and those on fire inflamed Augustus so, that my glad honors turned to wretched grief.",
    "My mind, to vent its feelings of disdain, and thinking to avoid disdain by death, made me unjust against myself, the just.",
    "By this tree's uncouth roots, I swear to you, I never broke the faith I owed my lord, who so deserving was of reverence!",
    "And to the world should one of you return, let him assist my memory, which still lies crushed beneath the blow which envy gave it!\"",
    "A while he waited, then the Poet said: \"Since he is still, lose not thy chance; but speak, and ask him other questions, if thou like.\"",
    "Whence I to him: \"Ask thou again whate'er thou thinkest satisfactory to me; for I could not, such pity stirs my heart!\"",
    "Hence he began again: \"So may this man do freely for thee what thy words request, imprisoned spirit, may it please thee still to tell us how within these knotted trunks a soul is bound; and tell us, if thou canst, if any from such limbs is ever freed.\"",
    "Thereat the trunk blew hard, and afterward that wind was changed into the following words: \"Briefly shall a reply be made to you.",
    "Whenever a wild spirit leaves the body, from which itself hath torn itself away, Minos commits it to the seventh ravine.",
    "Into the wood it falls, nor is a place allotted to it; but where Fortune hurls it, there, like a grain of spelt, it germinates.",
    "It grows into a sapling and wild tree; the Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves, cause pain to it, and for the pain a vent.",
    "Like other spirits, for our spoils we 'll come, though not that any be reclothed therewith; for 't is not right to have what one casts off.",
    "We 'll drag them with us here, and then our bodies will all around the dismal wood be hung, each on the thorn-tree of its hostile shade.\"",
    "We still were giving heed unto the trunk, believing that it wished to tell us more, when we were startled by a sudden noise, as likewise he is, who perceives a boar and pack of hounds approach his hunting-post, and hears the crashing of the beasts and boughs.",
    "And lo, two on the left, who naked were and scratched, and fled away so rapidly, they shattered all the branches of the wood.",
    "The one ahead: \"Now hurry, hurry, death!\" and the other one, who thought himself too slow, cried: \"Lano, not so knowing were thy legs, when running from Del Toppo's battle-jousts!\" And then, perhaps because of failing breath, he there made of himself and of a bush a group.",
    "The wood behind these two was full of swarthy bitches, ravenous and fleet as greyhounds are, when from their chains unleashed.",
    "Into the one who crouched they set their teeth, and tore him into pieces bit by bit; they then made off with those his suffering limbs.",
    "Thereat my Escort took me by the hand, and led me to the bush, which all in vain out of its bleeding rents was shedding tears.",
    "\"O Giàcomo\" it said, \"da Sant'Andrea, what boots it thee to make a screen of me? and how am I to blame for thy bad life?\"",
    "When over him my Teacher stopped, he said: \"Who then wast thou, that through so many gashes art blowing forth with blood such painful speech?\"",
    "And he to us: \"O spirits that have come in time to see the unbecoming havoc, which from me thus hath torn away my leaves, collect them at the foot of my sad bush! I to that town belonged, which for the Baptist changed its first patron; wherefore he, for this, will always make her mournful with his art; and were it not that on the Arno's bridge there lingers still some little glimpse of him, those townsmen who rebuilt her afterward over the ashes left by Attila, had caused that work to be performed in vain.",
    "I made myself a gibbet of my house.\"",
    "Since love for my own native place constrained me, I gathered up the scattered twigs and leaves, and gave them back to him who now was weak.",
    "Thence to the bound we came, where from the third the second ring is severed, and wherein a frightful form of Justice may be seen.",
    "To manifest aright what here was new, I say that we had reached a barren plain, which from its bed removeth every plant.",
    "The woeful wood is as a garland round it, as round the former is the dismal moat; there on its very edge we stayed our steps.",
    "Its soil was of a dense and arid sand, whose nature differed in no way from that, which once was trodden by the feet of Cato.",
    "Vengeance of God, how much by every one thou oughtest to be feared, who readeth here what to these eyes of mine was manifest!",
    "Of naked souls I many flocks beheld, who all wept very sorely, while on each a different law appeared to be imposed.",
    "A few lay on the ground upon their backs; and some were seated cuddled up together, while others moved about continually.",
    "Most numerous were those that moved around, and least so those that under torment lay, but all the freer had their tongues to wail.",
    "Down on the whole great waste of sand there rained with gentle fall dilated flakes of fire, like flakes of snow that fall on windless Alps.",
    "As were the flames which Alexander saw in India's torrid regions, as they fell upon his hosts, unbroken to the ground; — and this he met, by ordering his troops to trample on the soil, because the flames, when single, were more easily put out — even such descended here the eternal heat, whereby the sand was set on fire, as tinder is kindled under steel, to double pain.",
    "And ever without resting was the dance of wretched hands, that kept, now here, now there, slapping away each latest burning flake.",
    "\"Thou, Teacher,\" I began, \"that conquerest all, except the stubborn devils who came out against us at the entrance of the gate, who is that great one who seems not to mind the fire, but lies there scornful and awry, so that the rain seems not to ripen him?\"",
    "And that same one, who had observed that I concerning him was questioning my Leader, cried: \"As I was alive, such am I dead! If Jove should tire that smith of his, from whom, in wrath, he took the pointed thunderbolt, wherewith I smitten was that final day; or should he tire the others, each in turn, in Mongibello's smithy black with smoke, by calling out: ‘Help, help, good Vulcan, help!' even as he did on Phlegra's battle-field; and should he shoot at me with all his might, no glad revenge would he obtain thereby!\"",
    "Thereat my Leader spoke with so much force, that I had never heard him use the like: \"In that thine arrogance, O Capaneus, is not extinguished, art thou all the more chastised; no torment, saving thine own rage, were for thy furious pride a fitting pain.\"",
    "Then with a gentler mien he turned to me, and said: \"One of the seven kings was he, who Thebes besieged; he held, and seems to hold God in disdain, and little seems to prize Him; but, as I told him, his own spitefulness is fit enough adornment for his breast.",
    "Now follow me, and see that thou meanwhile set not thy feet upon the burning sand, but to the thicket keep them ever close.\"",
    "In silence we went on, and came to where, out of the wood a little stream spirts forth, whose ruddy color makes me shudder still.",
    "As from the Bulicàmë springs a brook, which afterward the sinful women share, even so went that one down across the sand.",
    "Its bottom and both sides had turned to stone, as also had the embankments on each side; I hence perceived the crossing-place was there.",
    "\"Of all the other things which I have shown thee since first we entered through the outer gate, whose threshold unto no one is denied, nothing has ever by thine eyes been seen as notable as is this present brook, which deadens o'er itself all little flames.\"",
    "These were my Leader's words; I therefore begged that he would freely grant to me the food, desire of which he had so freely given.",
    "\"Amid the sea there lies a wasted land,\" he told me thereupon, \"whose name is Crete, under whose king the world of old was pure.",
    "There is a mountain there, which, happy once with waters and green leaves, was Ida called; 't is now abandoned like a thing outworn.",
    "Whilom as trusty cradle for her son Rhea selected it, and when he wept, to hide him better, caused a shouting there.",
    "Within that mountain stands a great Old Man, who holds his shoulders toward Damiata turned, and who, as at his mirror, looks at Rome.",
    "His head is formed of finest gold, his arms and breast are of the purest silver, then, as far as to his loins, he 's made of brass; all chosen iron is he down from there, save that baked clay his right foot is, and straighter he stands on that, than on the other foot.",
    "Each of these parts, except the golden one, is broken by a cleft, whence trickle tears, which, when collected, perforate that cave.",
    "From rock to rock they course into this vale; then Acheron with Styx and Phlegethon they form, and through this narrow duct descend as far as where one goes no further down; they form Cocytus there; and what that pool is like, thou 'lt see; hence here it is not told.",
    "And I to him: \"If thus this present stream hs from our world descended, why alone on this ring's edge hath it appeared to us?\"",
    "And he: \"Thou knowest that the place is round, and though a long way thou hast gone already, e'er to the left descending toward the bottom, through the whole circle thou hast not yet gone; wherefore, if aught that 's new appear to us, it should not bring amazement to thy face.\"",
    "And I again: \"But where are Phlegethon and Lethe, Teacher? For, of this one silent, thou say'st the other of this rain is made.\"",
    "And he replied: \"Thou certainly dost please me in all thy questions, but the red stream's boiling ought surely to have answered one of them.",
    "Lethe thou 'lt see, but there, outside this cave, whither souls go to wash themselves, when once their sin, repented of, has been removed.\"",
    "And then he said: \"It now is time for us to leave the wood; see that thou follow me; the banks, which are not burned, afford a path; and up above them every flame is quenched.\"",
    "One of the hard embankments bears us now, and overhead the brook's mist shades them so, that from the fire it saves the stream and banks.",
    "Such bulwarks as, to keep the sea away, the Flemings make between Witsand and Bruges, through fearing lest the high-tide break upon them; and as the Paduans make along the Brenta, their villages and strongholds to defend, ere Chiarentana feel the summer heat; in such a way were those embankments made, although the master did not make them there so high or thick, whoe'er he may have been.",
    "So far we were already from the wood, that I could not have seen just where it was, even had I turned around to look behind, when we a band of spirits met, who came along the bank, each one of whom looked hard at us, as in the evening one is wont to look at people, when the moon is new; and toward us they were knitting close their brows, as an old tailor at his needle's eye.",
    "When by that gathering I had thus been eyed, one of them, who had recognized me, seizing my garment's hem, exclaimed: \"How wonderful!\"",
    "And I, when toward me he had stretched his arm, fastened upon his roasted face mine eyes, so that, though blistered, it did not prevent mine intellect from recognizing him; and downward having bent my face toward his, I answered him: \"Are you here, Ser Brunetto?\"",
    "And that one: \"O my son, be not displeased should Brunetto Latini a little way turn back with thee, and let the troop go on.\"",
    "\"I beg you to with all my power;\" said I, \"and if you 'd have me sit with you, I will, if it please that one; for with him I go.\"",
    "\"O son,\" he said, \"whoever of this herd stands still at all, lies prone a hundred years, nor shields himself when smitten by the fire.",
    "Therefore go on; I 'll follow at thy skirts, and then I 'll join again my company, which goes bewailing its eternal loss.\"",
    "I dared not from the path descend, to go upon his level there; but held my head bowed down, like one who walks in reverence.",
    "And he began: \"What fortune or what fate before thy last day leadeth thee down here, and who is he that showeth thee the way?\"",
    "I answered him: \"When in the life serene up yonder, in a vale I lost my way, before my age had rounded out its noon.",
    "Thereon I turned my back but yestermorn; this one, as I returned to it, appeared to me, and o'er this path now leads me home.\"",
    "And he to me: \"If thine own star thou follow, thou canst not fail to reach a glorious port, if in the lovely life I judged aright; and had I not so prematurely died, I, seeing Heaven so well disposed toward thee, had given thee comfort in thy work.",
    "But that ungrateful, wicked people, which of old came down from Fièsolë, and which e'en now smacks of the mountain and of hard grey stone, for thy well-doing shall become thy foe; and rightly, for among the acid sorbs it is not fitting that sweet figs bear fruit.",
    "An old fame in the world proclaims them blind, a greedy, envious, overweening folk; see to it that thou cleanse thee from their ways! Thy fortune hath in store for thee such honor, that either party shall be hungry for thee; but distant from the goat shall be the grass.",
    "Let, then, the beasts of Fièsolë make litter with their own selves, nor let them touch the plant, if on their dungheap any burgeon still,",
    "in which the sacred seed may live again of those old Romans who remained therein, when of such wickedness the nest was made!\"",
    "\"If perfectly fulfilled had been my prayer,\" I then replied to him, \"you had not yet been banished from the natural life of man; for in my mind is fixed, and stirs e'en now my heart, that dear and kind paternal face you showed, when in the world from time to time you taught me how man makes himself eternal; and how much gratitude I feel for this, must, while I live, be in my words perceived.",
    "What of my course you tell, I write, and keep, with other texts, for a Lady to explain, who can, if ever I attain to her.",
    "I only wish that this be clear to you, that I, if but my conscience chide me not, am ready for whatever Fortune wills.",
    "Not new unto mine ears is such reward; hence, as she lists, let Fortune turn her wheel, and let the country clown his mattock ply!\"",
    "Thereat my Teacher over his right cheek turned back, and looked at me; and then he said: \"He listens well, who giveth heed to this.\"",
    "Nor speaking less do I, on this account, go on with Ser Brunetto, asking who his fellows were, of greatest note and rank.",
    "And he to me: 'T is well to know of some; our silence on the rest will merit praise, for short the time were for so long a talk.",
    "Know then, in brief, that clerics were they all, and mighty men of letters of great fame, soiled by the self same sin when in the world.",
    "And with that sad crowd yonder Priscian goes, and Francis of Accorso, too; and him, if thou hadst had a longing for such scurf, thou couldst have seen there, whom the servants' Servant changed from the Arno to the Bacchigliònë, where he behind him left his ill-strained nerves.",
    "I 'd speak of more; but I can come and talk no further, for a new dust-cloud I see rising o'er yonder from the sandy plain.",
    "People, with whom I must not be, are coming; let my Tesoro, in which I 'm still alive, be recommended thee; I ask no more.\"",
    "Then round he turned, and seemed to be of those who at Verona run across the meadow to win the green cloth; and of these he seemed not he who loses, but the one who wins.",
    "I now was where the booming of the water, which fell into the following round, was heard like the dull, buzzing sound which bee-hives make; when three shades separated from a group, which 'neath the rain's tormenting punishment was passing by, and ran along together.",
    "Toward us they came, and each of them cried out: \"Stop, thou, that by thy garb dost seem to us a citizen of our corrupted town!\"",
    "Alas, what wounds I saw upon their limbs, both old and recent, by the flames burnt in! It pains me still but to remember them.",
    "My Leader, giving heed to these their cries, turned his face round toward me, and said: \"Now wait! To those men yonder courtesy is due; and, were not for the fire, which, arrow-like, the nature of the place shoots forth, I 'd say that haste were more becoming thee than them.\"",
    "And they, when we had stopped, began again their old refrain; and after they had reached us, all three of them made of themselves a wheel.",
    "As champions oiled and nude are wont to do, when looking for an advantageous grip, before they come to giving blows and wounds; thus, as he wheeled, each turned his face toward me, so that his feet continuous journey made in opposite direction to his neck.",
    "And one began: \"Even if the wretched nature of this soft place, and our burned, shrivelled faces bring us and our requests into contempt, still let our reputation bend thy mind to tell us who thou art, that dost so safely rub on the soil of Hell thy living feet.",
    "He, in whose footprints thou dost see me tread, was, though he go both nude and hairless now, of higher rank then thou believest him.",
    "He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada; his name was Guido Guerra, and when alive, his wisdom and his sword accomplished much.",
    "The other, who behind me treads the sand, Tegghiàio Aldobrandi is, whose voice should have been welcomed in the world above.",
    "And I, who with them am tormented here, Iàcopo Rusticucci was; and surely my shrewish wife than aught else hurts me more.\"",
    "If I had been protected from the fire, I would have lept into their midst below, and I believe my Leader had allowed it.",
    "But since I should have burned and baked myself, fear was victorious over my good will, which made me eager to embrace them there.",
    "I then began: \"Your state impressed within me not scorn, but so much pain, that only late will all of it entirely disappear, as soon as this my Lord said words to me, because of which I thought within myself that there were people coming such as you.",
    "Of your own town am I, and evermore have I your doings and your honored names related, and heard mentioned, with regard.",
    "I leave the gall, and for the sweet fruit go, which my veracious Leader promised me; but to the center must I first descend.\"",
    "\"So may thy spirit lead thy members long,\" the former thereupon replied to me, \"and, after thou art gone, thy fame be bright, tell me if courtesy and worth abide within our town, as they were wont to do, or whether they have wholly gone from it; for Guglielmo Borsierë, who but newly has been in pain with us, and with our mates goes yonder, grieves us greatly with his words.\"",
    "\"The people newly come, and sudden gains, have bred in thee such pride and such excess, that, Florence, thou art even now in pain!\"",
    "Thus with uplifted face I cried; whereat the three, who this as answer understood, looked at each other, as one looks at truth.",
    "\"If satisfying others other times cost thee so little, happy thou, that thus at thy sweet will dost speak!\" they all replied.",
    "\"Hence, — so mayst thou, from these dark places saved, return to see the lovely stars again, — when saying ‘I was there' shall do thee good, see that thou tell the people about us.\" They then broke up their wheel, and in their flight it seemed as if their nimble legs were wings.",
    "Amen could not have been as quickly said, as they then disappeared; my Teacher, therefore, thought it advisable for us to leave.",
    "I followed him, and not far had we gone, before the water's noise was so near by, that, had we spoken, we had not been heard.",
    "And as the stream, which is the first that eastward from Monte Veso takes a separate course upon the left slope of the Apennines, and which above is Acquacheta called, before it flows into its lowly bed, and at Forla is of that name deprived, booms loud, because of falling o'er a cliff above San Benedetto of the Alp, where for a thousand there should refuge be;",
    "even thus, as o'er a precipice it fell, we found that colored water roaring so, that very soon it would have hurt our ears.",
    "I had a cord around about me girt, wherewith I once had thought that I could capture the Leopard with the brightly colored hide.",
    "When from me I had wholly loosened it, even as my Leader had commanded me, I coiled it up and held it out to him.",
    "Thereat upon his right he turned around, and hurled it to some distance from the edge down into that profound and dark abyss.",
    "\"Surely some strange new thing must needs reply\" said I within myself, \"to this strange signal, which with his eye my Teacher follows thus.\"",
    "Ah, with what caution men should deal with those, who see not only what is done by others, but with their wisdom see into their thoughts!",
    "He said to me: \"What I am waiting for, and what thy thought now dreams, will soon come up; soon to thy vision will it be revealed.\"",
    "E'er to a truth that hath a falsehood's face ought one to close his lips as best he can, for, though one faultless be, it brings him shame; but I can not suppress it here; hence, Reader, even by the verses of this Comedy, so may they not be void of lasting favor,",
    "I swear to thee, that through that coarse, dark air I saw a shape, which would have chilled with wonder however brave a heart, come swimming up, as he returns, who, going down at times to clear an anchor clinging to a reef, or aught else lying hidden in the sea, above extends, and draweth in below.",
    "\"Behold the wild beast with the pointed tail, which, crossing mountains, breaks through walls and armor; behold who sickens all the world with stench!\"",
    "My Leader thus began to speak to me, and signalled to it to approach the edge, near where the marble we had traversed ended.",
    "And that foul image of deceit came on, and landed on the bank its head and chest; but o'er the edge it drew not up its tail.",
    "Its face was as the face of a just man, so pleasing outwardly was its complexion; the body of a serpent all the rest.",
    "Two paws it had, all hairy to the arm-pits; its back and breast, as well as both its sides, were painted o'er with snares and wheel-like shields.",
    "Ne'er with more colors in its woof and warp did Turks or Tartars manufacture cloth, nor by Arachnne were such webs designed.",
    "As flat-boats sometimes lie upon the shore, in water partly, partly on the land; and as among the greedy Germans yonder,",
    "the beaver seats himself to wage his war; so lay that worst of beasts upon the edge which closes in the sandy plain with stone.",
    "All of its tail was quivering in the void, and twisting upward its envenomed fork, which like a scorpion's weapon armed its tip.",
    "\"Our path must turn aside a little now,\" my Leader said to me, \"until we reach that wicked beast reclining over there.\"",
    "Around our right breast, therefore, we went down, and took ten paces on the very edge, thus surely to avoid both sand and fire; and after we had come to it, I saw, upon the sand a little further on, some people sitting near the precipice.",
    "My Teacher then: \"That thou mayst take with thee a full experience of this ring, go on, and see the nature of the life they lead.",
    "There be thy conversation brief; meanwhile, till thou return, I 'll talk with this wild beast, that its strong shoulders may be yielded us.\"",
    "Thus further on, along the outer edge of that seventh circle, all alone I went, to where the melancholy people sat.",
    "Out of their eyes their woe was bursting forth; first here, then there, they helped them with their hands, now from the flames, now from the heated soil.",
    "Not otherwise do dogs in summer-time, now with their paws, and with their muzzles now, whene'er by flees, or flies, or gadflies bitten.",
    "When on the face of some I set mine eyes, on whom the woeful fire is falling there, I knew not one of them; but I perceived that from the neck of each there hung a pouch, which had a certain color and design, wherewith their eyes appeared to feed themselves.",
    "And as I, looking, came into their midst, azure upon a yellow pouch I saw, which had the form and semblance of a lion.",
    "Then, as my gaze continued on its course, another I beheld, as red as blood, exhibiting a goose more white than butter.",
    "And one of them, who had his small white pouch emblazoned with an azure pregnant sow, said to me: \"What dost thou in this our ditch? Now go thy way; and since thou livest still, know that my fellow townsman, Vitaliano, will sit beside me here upon my left.",
    "I, with these Florentines, a Paduan am, and very frequently they stun my ears by shouting: \"Let the sovereign knight arrive, who 'll bring with him the pocket with three beaks!\"' Herewith his mouth he twisted, sticking out his tongue, as doth an ox that licks its nose.",
    "And I, afraid lest any longer stay might anger him who warned me to be brief, turned from those weary spirits back again.",
    "I found my Leader, who had climbed already upon the back of that fierce animal, and said to me: \"Now be thou strong and bold! By stairs like these shall we descend hereafter; climb thou in front, for midst I wish to be, so that the tail may do no injury.\"",
    "Like one with quartan-fever's chill so near, that pale already are his finger nails, and that, but looking at the shade, he shudders; such at the words he uttered I became; but that shame made its threats to me, which renders a servant strong when in a good lord's presence.",
    "As on those horrid shoulders I sat down, I wished to tell him: \"See that thou embrace me!\" my voice, however, came not as I thought.",
    "But he, who succoured me at other times and other straights, as soon as I was up, encircled and sustained me with his arms; and then he said: \"Now, Geryon, move thou on! Wide be thy wheels, and gradual thy descent; bethink thee of the unwonted load thou hast.\"",
    "As from its mooring place a little boat backs slowly out, even so did he withdraw; and when he wholly felt himself in play,",
    "to where his breast had been, he turned his tail, and moved the latter, stretched out like an eel, while with his paws he gathered in the air.",
    "I do not think that there was greater fear when Phaëthon let go his horses' reins, whereby, as still appears, the sky was burned; nor yet when wretched Icarus perceived his back unfeathering through the melting wax, while, calling him, his father cried: \"Thou hold'st an evil course!\" than mine was, when I saw that I was in the air on every side, and gone the sight of all things save the beast.",
    "The latter, swimming, slowly wends his way, wheels and descends, but I perceive it not, save by the wind below and in my face.",
    "The waterfall I now heard on the right, making a horrid roar beneath us; hence, I outward thrust my head with eyes turned down.",
    "More fearful of the abyss I then became, for fires I now beheld, and wailings heard; hence, trembling, I clung closer with my thighs.",
    "And then, for I perceived it not before, by the great torments which on divers sides drew near, I saw our wheeling and descent.",
    "Even as a falcon long upon the wing, which, without seeing lure or game-bird, makes the falconer say: \"Alas, thou comest down!\"",
    "descendeth weary, through a hundred rings, whence he had swiftly started, and alights far from his lord in angry sullenness; so likewise Geryon set us down below, close to the bottom of the rough-hewn rock; and, of our persons rid, as fast as flies an arrow from a bowstring, sped away.",
    "A place there is in Hell, called Malebolgë, wholly of stone, and of an iron hue, as is the round wall which encircles it.",
    "Right in the midst of its malicious field yawneth a well exceeding wide and deep, of whose construction, in its place, I 'll speak.",
    "Round, therefore, is the girdle which remains between the well and that hard, high wall's base, and ten great trenches subdivide its bed.",
    "As is the appearance which, where many moats encircle castles for the walls' protection, the section where they are presents; such was the one those trenches furnished here; and just as in such fortresses small bridges stretch from their thresholds to the outmost bank; so crags ran from the bottom of the cliff across the banks and trenches to the well, which, gathering them together, cuts them off.",
    "In this place, then, we found ourselves, when dropped from Geryon's back; the Poet thereupon held to the left, and I behind him moved.",
    "Upon the right side I beheld new cause for sympathy, new pains, and scourgers new, wherewith the first trench was completely filled.",
    "Down at its bottom naked were the sinners; this side the middle facing us they came, beyond it with us, but with quicker steps; means such as those which at the Jubilee the Romans took, because of its great throng, to have the people pass across the bridge, who toward the Castle all on one side face, and toward Saint Peter's go their way; while all move toward the mountain on the other edge.",
    "This side and that, upon the dark, stone floor, horned demons with great scourges I beheld, who from behind were fiercely whipping them.",
    "Ah, how they caused them to lift them up their heels, when by the first blows smitten! Certainly none waited for the second, or the third.",
    "While I was going on, mine eyes were met by one of them; and instantly I said: \"I fast not from a previous sight of him.\" To make him out I therefore stayed my feet; and, having stopped with me, my gentle Leader assented to my going back a little.",
    "That scourged one thought that he could hide himself by looking down, but little it availed him; for \"Thou, that castest down thine eyes,\" said I,",
    "unless the features which thou hast are false, Venèdico Caccianimico art; but what brings thee into such pungent sauces?\"",
    "And he to me: \"Unwillingly I tell it; but forced I am by thy transparent speech, which makes me recollect the olden world.",
    "I was the one who led Ghisolabella to do according to the Marquis' will, however the disgusting tale be told.",
    "Nor am I here the only Bolognese that weeps; nay, this place is so full of us, that not so many tongues are taught today between Savena and Reno to say sipa; and if thereof thou wouldst have pledge or proof, recall to mind our avaricious breasts.\"",
    "As thus he spoke, a demon with his lash smote him, and said to him: \"Pandar, begone! There are no women here to sell for coin.\"",
    "I then rejoined my Escort; whereupon, when we had taken some few steps, we came to where a crag projected from the bank.",
    "This we ascended with the greatest ease, and turning to the right along its ridge, we left those everlasting circling walls.",
    "When we were where it hollows out below, to let the scourged pass through, my Leader said: \"Now stay thy steps, and on thee let the sight",
    "of all these other ill-born spirits strike, whose faces thou hast not perceived as yet, because they 've gone with us in our direction.\"",
    "As from the ancient bridge we watched the troop, which on the other side was toward us coming, and which the scourge was likewise driving on, without my asking, my good Teacher said: \"Look at that great man there, who, as he comes, for all his pain, seems not to shed a tear.",
    "How royal an appearance he still keeps! Jason is he, who, by his doughtiness and wit, deprived the Colchians of their ram.",
    "He passed the isle of Lemmos on his way, after its pitiless and daring women had given up to death their every male.",
    "With tokens of his love and flattering words he there deceived the maid, Hypsapylë, who previously had all the rest deceived.",
    "He left her there with child, and all alone; him to this punishment that fault condemns; and for Medea, too, is vengeance wrought.",
    "With him go those that in this way deceive; be this enough to know of this first ditch, and of those, too, that in its fangs it holds.\"",
    "Already were we where the narrow path forms with the second bank a cross, and makes therewith abutments for another arch.",
    "We thence heard people in the following trench who whined and groaned, and with their muzzles puffed, while smiting their own bodies with their palms.",
    "The banks were crusted over with a mould by vapor from below, which, sticking there, offensive to both eyes and nose became.",
    "So deep the bottom, that there is no means of looking into it, unless one climb the arch's summit, where the crag is highest.",
    "Thither we came, and from it in the ditch people I saw immersed in excrement, which seemed from human privies to have come.",
    "While peering with mine eyes down there, I saw a head so foul with filth, that whether clerk's or layman's head it were, was not apparent.",
    "Scolding, he said: \"Why greedier art thou to look at me, than at the other foul ones?\"",
    "And I: \"Because, if I remember well, I 've seen thee with dry hair ere now, for thou Alèssio Interminèi of Lucca art; that 's why I eye thee more than all the rest.\" And he then, as he beat upon his pate: \"Those flatteries immersed me here below, wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.\"",
    "Then, after this, my Leader said to me: \"See that thou urge thy glance a little further, that with thine eyes thou quite attain the face",
    "of that disgusting and dishevelled wench, who yonder claws herself with filthy nails, and crouches now, and now is on her feet.",
    "That Thaïs is, the prostitute, who answered her paramour, when he had said ‘Have I great thanks from thee?': ‘Nay, marvelously great!' Herewith, then, let our sight be satisfied.\"",
    "O Simon Magus, O his wretched followers, since ye the things of God, which ought to be the brides of righteousness, rapaciously adulterate for silver and for gold; it now behooves the trumpet sound for you, for in the third great trench your station is!",
    "We now had climbed the next tomb-spanning bridge, and were on that part of the crag, which hangs directly o'er the middle of the trench.",
    "Wisdom Supreme, how great the art thou showest in Heaven, on earth, and in the evil world! How justly, too, thy virtue makes awards!",
    "I saw that on its sloping sides and bottom the livid-colored stone was full of holes, all of one width, while each of them was round.",
    "Nor less nor more wide did they seem to me, than those which in my beautiful Saint John's are made as places for baptizing priests; and one of which, not many years ago, I broke, to save one who was choking in it; be this a witness undeceiving all!",
    "Out of the mouth of each a sinner's feet protruded, and, as far as to the calf, his legs; the rest of him remained within.",
    "The soles of all were, both of them, on fire; because of which their joints so strongly twitched, they would have snapped green twigs and cords of grass.",
    "And as a flame on oily things is wont to move along the outer surface only; so likewise was it there from heels to toes.",
    "\"Who, Teacher, is he yonder, who is tortured by twitching more than all the rest, his mates,\" said I, \"and whom a redder flame is sucking?\"",
    "And he to me: \"If thou wouldst have me bear thee down yonder bank which lowest lies, from him thou 'lt know both of himself and of his sins.\"",
    "And I: \"What pleases thee I like; my lord thou art, and that I part not from thy will thou knowst, as also what is left unsaid.\"",
    "We then upon the fourth embankment came, and, turning round, descended on our left into that narrow bottom pierced with holes; nor yet did my good Teacher set me down from off his back, but brought me to the hole of him who grieved so sorely with his shank.",
    "\"Whoe'er thou art, sad soul, that holdest down thine upper portion, planted like a stake,\" I then began, \"say something, if thou canst.\"",
    "I there was like a friar that confesses a base assassin, who, on being planted, calls him again, that death may be delayed.",
    "And he cried out: \"Dost thou stand there already, dost thou stand there already, Boniface? By several years the writing lied to me.",
    "Art thou so quickly sated with the wealth, for which thou didst not fear to seize by fraud, and outrage next, the Lady beautiful?\"",
    "Even such did I become, as those are, who, not understanding what is answered them, deem themselves mocked, and think of no reply.",
    "Then Virgil said: \"Tell him immediately: ‘I 'm not the one, I 'm not the one thou thinkest!'\" And I replied to him as I was bidden.",
    "Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet; then, sighing, and with weeping voice, he said: \"What is it, then, that thou dost ask of me? If to know who I am concern thee so, that for it thou hast crossed the bank; know, then, that I was with the mighty Mantle clothed; and verily the she-Bear's son was I, so eager to advance the cubs, that wealth I pocketed up there, and here myself.",
    "The others, who in working simony preceded me, are gathered 'neath my head, flattened between the fissures of the rock.",
    "I, in like manner, shall down yonder fall, when he arrives, whom I believed thou wast, when I of thee the sudden question asked.",
    "But now already longer is the time, that I, thus up-side down, have cooked my feet, than he will planted stay with ruddy soles; for after him shall come from westward lands a lawless shepherd of still uglier deed, and fit to cover him and me.",
    "Renewed shall Jason be, of whom in Maccabees one reads; and as to that one his king yielded, even so who governs France shall yield to this.\"",
    "I know not whether I was here too bold, in that I answered him in this strain only: \"Now tell me, pray, how great the treasure was, our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first, before He placed the Keys in his control? Surely he asked for naught but ‘Follow me.' Nor yet did Peter or the rest take gold or silver from Matthias, when by lot he took the place the guilty soul had lost.",
    "Therefore keep still, for thou art rightly punished; and take good care of that ill-gotten wealth, which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.",
    "And were it not for this, that I am still forbidden by reverence for the Keys supreme thou hadst in keeping in the joyful life,",
    "words of still greater weight would I employ; because your greed, by trampling on the good and raising the depraved, afflicts the world.",
    "The Evangelist was thinking of your shepherds, when she, who on the waters hath her seat, was seen by him to fornicate with kings; the one who with the seven heads was born, and from the ten horns her support received, while virtue still was pleasing to her spouse.",
    "Ye' ve made yourselves a god of gold and silver; and from idolaters how differ ye, save that they worship one, and ye a hundred?",
    "Ah, Constantine, of how much ill was mother, not thy conversion, but the dower-gift the earliest wealthy Father took from thee!\"",
    "While I was singing him such notes as these, he, whether it were wrath or conscience bit him, was fiercely kicking out with both his feet.",
    "I verily believe it pleased my Leader, he heeded with so glad a look throughout the utterance of those true, clear words of mine.",
    "He therefore took me up with both his arms, and when he had me wholly on his breast, he climbed again the path down which he came; nor tired of holding me in his embrace, but bore me to the summit of the arch, which crosses from the fourth bank to the fifth.",
    "When there, he gently set his burden down, gently, because that crag was rough and steep, and would be difficult for goats to cross; from thence another trench was shown to me.",
    "About strange punishments must I make verses, and furnish matter for the twentieth song of this first lay, which treats of those submerged.",
    "Already had I wholly given myself to looking down at its uncovered bottom, which with the tears of agony was bathed; when people in the great round trench I saw come weeping silently, and at the pace, at which in this world litanies advance.",
    "Then, as my sight fell on them lower down, wondrously twisted each of them appeared between the chin and where the chest begins; for toward his loins his face was turned around, and backward it behooved him to advance, because of foresight they had been deprived.",
    "By palsy some, perhaps, may thus have been entirely turned around, but I 've not seen it, nor do I think there ever was one such.",
    "So may God let thee, Reader, gather fruit from this thy reading, think now for thyself how I could ever keep my own face dry,",
    "when at close range I saw our human image so twisted, that the weeping of the eyes along the fissure bathed the back.",
    "Indeed, as on a rock of that hard crag I leaned, I wept so, that my Escort said to me: \"Art thou still foolish as the others are? Here liveth piety when wholly dead is pity.",
    "Who, then, guiltier is than he who lets his feelings judge Divine Decrees?",
    "Lift, lift thy head, and see the man for whom, before the Trojans' eyes, the earth was opened! whence all cried: ‘Whither art thou rushing now, Amphiaràus? Why quittest thou the war?' and he ceased not from plunging headlong down to Minos, who lays hold on every one.",
    "See how he makes a bosom of his shoulders; because he wished to see too far ahead, he looks behind, and backward goes his way.",
    "Behold Tiresias there, who changed his looks, when female he became, from being male, his members being each and all transformed; and afterward he needs must strike again the two entwining serpents with his rod, ere he the plumage of a male regained.",
    "He who to that one's belly turns his back, is Aruns, who in Luni's mountain quarries, where toils the Carrarese who dwells below,",
    "among white marbles had as dwelling-place a cave, from which his view was not cut off, when at the stars he gazed, or at the sea.",
    "And she who, yonder, with dishevelled locks covers the breasts which thou dost not behold, and has on that side all her hairy skin, was Manto, who first searched through many lands, then settled in the place where I was born; thereof I 'd have thee hear me speak a little.",
    "After her father had from life departed, and Bacchus' city had become enslaved, she wandered long about the world.",
    "Up there in lovely Italy, beneath the Alps which o'er the Tyrol lock out Germany, there lies a lake which is Benàco called.",
    "From o'er a thousand springs, I trow, 'tween Garda and Val Camònica, the Pennine Alp is bathed by waters which therein find rest.",
    "A midway place there is, where Trento's shepherd, and he of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each his blessing give, if there he went.",
    "Peschiera next, a fair and mighty fortress, and fit to face both Bergamasks and Brescians, sits where the shore lies lowest round about.",
    "There all that in Benàco's spacious lap cannot be held, flows out of it perforce, and down through verdant pastures forms a stream.",
    "When once its water gathers head to run, no more Benàco, Mincio is its name, till at Govèrnolo it joins the Po.",
    "Not long its course, before it finds low ground, o'er which it spreads, and, making it a marsh, is wont at times to be unsound in summer.",
    "Passing that way, the cruel virgin saw a region in the middle of the fen, untilled and naked of inhabitants.",
    "There, to escape all human fellowship, and work her arts, she settled with her slaves, and lived, and there she left her empty body.",
    "Thereafter men, who all around were scattered, collected in that place, which was a strong one, because it had a fen on every side.",
    "O'er those dead bones of hers they built a town; then, after her, who first picked out the site, they called it Mantua, with no other lot.",

    "He told me then: \"The one who from his cheeks extends his beard across his swarthy shoulders, an augur was, when Greece lacked males so much, that for her cradles only few were left; 't was he who set, with Chalcas' aid, at Aulis the time to cut the fleet's first rope.",

    "And just such sticky pitch as that which boils in the Venetians' Arsenal in winter, for calking up again the unsound ships, which cannot then be sailed; — instead of which, as one a new one builds, one plugs the ribs of that which many voyages has made; one hammers at the stern, and at the prow another; one fashions oars, another cordage twists, while still another mends a jib or mainsail; — such was the coarse, dense pitch, which, not by fire, but by an art divine, boiled there below, and limed the bank on every side.",
    "I saw the pitch, but nothing in it, save the bubbles the boiling raised, and that the whole of it kept swelling up, and settling back compressed.",
    "While I was gazing fixedly down yonder, my Leader cried to me: \"Beware, beware!\" and drew me to himself from where I was.",
    "I then turned round, as one who longs to see the thing which it behooves him to escape, and who, when by a sudden fear unmanned, although he sees, delays not his departure; and I perceived behind us a black devil come running up along the rocky crag.",
    "Ah, how ferocious in his looks he was, and in his actions how severe he seemed, with wings outspread, and light upon his feet! His shoulder, which was sharp and high, was loaded with both a sinner's haunches, whom he held clutched tightly by the sinews of his feet.",
    "\"O Malebranche,\" from our bridge he cried, \"here 's one of Santa Zita's Ancients! Put him beneath, for I 'm for more of them returning to that town which I have well stocked therewith; there, save Bonturo, every one 's a grafter; a ‘No' for money there becomes a ‘Yes.'\"",
    "He hurled him down, and o'er the rugged crag returned; and never was a mastif loosed with so much hurry to pursue a thief.",
    "The other sank, and then rose doubled up; those fiends, though, who were sheltered by the bridge, cried: \"Here the Holy Face availeth not!",
    "One here swims otherwise than in the Serchio! If, therefore, thou dost not desire our hooks, protrude not from the surface of the pitch.\"",
    "They pricked him then with o'er a hundred prongs, and said: \"Here under cover must thou dance, that, if thou canst, thou mayst thieve secretly.\" Not otherwise do cooks have scullions plunge the meat with hooks into the cauldron's midst, to hinder it from floating on its surface.",
    "Thereat my kindly Teacher said to me: \"That here thy presence be not known, crouch down behind a rock, which may avail to screen thee; and be not thou afraid, for any harm that may be done to me, who know these things, for I in frays like this have been before.\"",
    "He then passed on beyond the bridge's head, and when the sixth embankment had been reached, he had to show assurance in his face.",
    "With just the storm and fury wherewith dogs break out and rush upon a poor old man, who stops and begs at once from where he is; from 'neath the little bridge those devils issued, and turned against him all their grappling hooks; but he cried out: \"Be none of you malicious! Before your grappling hooks take hold of me, let one of you advance, and hear me speak; then take ye counsel as to grappling me.\"",
    "Then all cried out: \"Let Malacoda go!\" Thereat one started, while the rest kept still, and, as he came, said: \"What does this avail him?\"",
    "\"Dost thou think, Malacoda,\" said my Teacher, \"that, as thou seest, I have hither come, safe until now from all your hindrances, unhelped by Will Divine and favoring fate? Let us go on, for it is willed in Heaven that I should show another this wild road.\"",
    "Thereat his pride received so great a fall, that at his feet he dropped his grappling hook, and to the rest said: \"Let him not be wounded.\"",
    "My Leader thereupon cried out to me: \"Thou that among the bridge's broken rocks art crouching, safely now regain my side.\"",
    "I therefore moved, and quickly came to him; then all the fiends advanced so far, I feared they would not keep their word.",
    "Even thus I once saw infantry, who, under pledge of safety, were from Caprona coming forth, afraid, when 'mong so many foes they saw themselves.",
    "Then wholly to my Leader's side I drew, nor from their faces, which did not look good, did I remove my eyes.",
    "For as their prongs they lowered, one fiend to another said: \"Wouldst thou that I should touch him on his rump?\" and they replied: \"Yes, see thou nick it for him!\"",
    "But that fiend, who was with my Leader talking, turned round at once, and said to him: \"Keep still, keep still there, Scarmiglionë!\" Then to us: \"Further advance along this present crag can not be made, because the sixth arch yonder lies wholly shattered on the ground below; but if it please you still to go ahead, go on along this ridge; there is near by another crag which furnishes a path.",
    "Than this hour five hours later yesterday, twelve hundred, six and sixty years had passed, since here the path was broken.",
    "I am sending some of my company in that direction, to see if any yonder air themselves; go on with them, for they will not be bad.\"",
    "\"Step forward, Alichino, and Calcabrina,\" he then began to say, \"thou, too, Cagnazzo; and let old Barbariccia guide the ten.",
    "Have Libicocco go, and Draghignazzo; tusked Ciriatto, too, and Graffiacane, with Farfarello and crazy Rubicante.",
    "Search round about the boiling birdlime pitch; let these be safe as far as that next crag, which all unbroken goes across the dens.\"",
    "\"Oh, Teacher, what is this I see?\" said I.",
    "\"If thou know how, pray let us go alone, for I request no escort for myself.",
    "If thou as wary art as thou art wont, dost thou not notice how they gnash their teeth, and with their eyebrows threaten us with woe?\"",
    "And he to me: \"I would not have thee frightened; let them grin on, then, as they like, for that they 're doing at the wretches who are boiled.\"",
    "They wheeled, and moved along the left bank then; but not till each, as signal toward their leader, had first thrust out his tongue between his teeth, and he had of his rump a trumpet made.",
    "Ere now have I seen cavalry break camp, start to attack, or be reviewed, and even, at times, retreat, in order to escape; scouts have I also seen upon your lands, O Aretines; raids, too, have I beheld, and tournaments and tilting-matches fought; with trumpets now, and now with bells, with drums and beacon-signals made from fortresses, with native and with foreign things; but never have I seen horse, or infantry, or ship, by sign of either land or sky, set out with instrument of wind as odd as that.",
    "With the ten demons we were going on; ah, the fierce company! But in a church with saints consort, with gluttons at an inn! Upon the pitch alone was I intent, that I might see all details of the trench and of the people who were burned therein.",
    "As dolphins do, when, arching up their backs, they give the warning which bids mariners take measures for the safety of their ship;",
    "even so at times, his suffering to relieve, one of the sinners there displayed his back, and hid it in less time than lightning takes.",
    "And as in ditches at the water's edge frogs stay with nothing but their muzzles out, and thus conceal their feet and all the rest; even so on all sides did those sinners stay; and now that Barbariccia was approaching, they likewise 'neath the boiling pitch withdrew.",
    "I saw, and still it stirs my heart with horror, one waiting thus, as oft, while one frog stays, it happens that another scurries off.",
    "And Graffiacane, who was nearest to him, hooking his pitch-smeared tresses, pulled him up, so that an otter he appeared to me.",
    "I knew by now the names of each and all, I noted them so well when they were chosen, and, when they called each other, noticed how.",
    "\"O Rubicante, see thou set thy claws upon him so, that thou peel off his skin!\" the accursèd all cried out together then.",
    "And I: \"My Teacher, if thou canst, contrive to learn who that wretch is, who thus has fallen into his adversaries' hands.\"",
    "My Leader thereupon drew near to him, and asked him whence he was, and he replied: \"Of Navarre's kingdom I a native was.",
    "My mother placed me out to serve a lord, for she had borne me to a rascal knave, who both himself and what he owned destroyed.",
    "I next in good King Thibaut's household served, and there I set myself to practice graft, for which I pay the reckoning in this heat.\"",
    "Here Ciriatto, from whose mouth protruded, as from a boar's, a tusk on either side, caused him to feel how one of them could rip.",
    "Among bad cats the mouse had fallen now; for Barbariccia clasped him in his arms, and said: \"Stand off, while I am clutching him!\" Then, toward my Teacher having turned his face, he said: \"Ask him again, if more thou wish to know of him, before the others rend him.\"",
    "My Leader then: \"Now tell me: know'st thou any, among the other sinners 'neath the pitch, who Latin is?\" And he: \"Not long ago I left a man from that vicinity; would that like him I still were covered up, for I should then fear neither claw nor hook!\"",
    "Here Libicocco said: \"We 've borne too much!\" and with his hook so seized him by the arm, and tore it, that he carried off a piece.",
    "And Draghignazzo also wished to clutch him down at his legs; but their decurion then turned right around at them with threatening looks.",
    "When they were somewhat pacified again, of him, who still was looking at his wound, my Leader asked without delay: \"Who, then, was he, from whom thou tookst unlucky leave, as thou hast said, to land upon the shore?\"",
    "And he made answer: \"That was Fra Gomita, Gallura's man, a vessel of all fraud, who, when he held in hand his master's foes, so dealt with them that each is glad.",
    "Their money he took, and, as he puts it, let them all off easy, and even in other offices was not a petty, but a first rate grafter.",
    "With him Don Michel Zanche of Logodoro associates; and never do their tongues feel tired out by talking of Sardinia.",
    "But oh! Look at the other grinning there! More would I say, but am afraid lest that one be making ready now to claw my skin.\"",
    "Then the great provost turned toward Farfarello, who rolled his eyes as if he meant to strike, and said: \"Off yonder, thou malicious bird!\"",
    "\"If you desire\" thereat began again the terror-stricken man, \"to see or hear Tuscans or Lombards, I will have some come.",
    "But let the Evil Claws here stand aside a little, that their vengeance be not feared, and I, while sitting in this very place,",
    "for one that I am, shall make seven come out, when I shall whistle, as our wont it is, when any one of us protrudes himself.\"",
    "Cagnazzo at this speech his muzzle raised, and shook his head, and said: \"Hear the sly trick devised by him to cast himself below!\"",
    "Then he, who frauds in great abundance had, replied to him: \"Tricky indeed am I, when for my mates a greater pain I win!\"",
    "Here Alichan could not control himself, but said, in opposition to the rest: \"I shall not gallop after thee, in case thou dive, but o'er the pitch shall beat my wings; the ridge abandoned, be the bank a screen, to see if thou alone art more than we!\"",
    "Now, Reader, of a new sport shalt thou hear! Each turned his eyes the other way; and he the first, who had thereto been most opposed.",
    "The Navarrese chose well his time, stood firmly upon the ground, and, jumping suddenly, from what they purposed freed himself thereby.",
    "For this each felt himself to blame, but most the one who of the loss had been the cause; hence he moved first, and shouted: \"Thou art caught!\" But little did it profit him; for wings could not outmeasure fear; as one went under, the other, flying upward, raised his breast;",
    "nor different is the speed with which a duck dives under water, when a hawk draws near, who, vexed and baffled thus, flies up again.",
    "Then Calcabrina, angered by the flout, flew out behind him, glad that one escaped, because it let him scuffle with the other; and then, the grafter having disappeared, he turned his claws upon his own companion, and grappled with him o'er the ditch; but he, being, indeed, a fighting sparrow-hawk fitted to claw him well, they both fell down into the middle of the boiling fen.",
    "A sudden separator was the heat; but rising thence was quite impossible, they had their wings so limed with sticky pitch.",
    "Then Barbariccia, vexed as were the rest, his mates, had four of them with all their hooks fly to the other bank; on both sides then they speedily descended to their posts, and stretched their hooks out toward the pitch-belimed, who now were cooked inside their crusted hides; and, thus embarassed, we abandoned them.",
    "Silent, alone, and unaccompanied, we went along, one first and one behind, as Minor Friars go when on the road.",
    "My thoughts, by reason of the present brawl, were turned to Aesop's fable, that wherein he talks about the frog and mouse; for ‘now' and ‘at this moment' are no more alike, than one is like the other, if beginning and end be linked by an attentive mind.",
    "And ev'n as one thought from another springs, so, next, from that one was another born, which doubled my first fear.",
    "Hence thus I thought: \"These devils have been scorned on our account, and with such injury and scoff, indeed, that I believe that they are greatly vexed.",
    "If anger to ill-will be joined, they 'll come more fiercely after us, than doth a dog the rabbit which he seizes with his teeth.\"",
    "Already was I feeling all my hair bristling with fear, when, gazing back intent, I said: \"If, Teacher, thou hide not thyself",
    "and me with speed, I dread the Evilclaws; we have them now behind us, and I so imagine them, that I already feel them.\"",
    "And he: \"If I were made of leaded glass, thine outward image I would not reflect more quickly than thine inward I receive.",
    "Even now thy thoughts were coming among mine with outlook and intent so similar, that I with both a single purpose formed.",
    "If it be true the right bank slopeth so, that to the following trench we can descend, we shall escape from this imagined chase.\"",
    "He had not finished telling me his plan, when not far off I saw them coming on with wings outspread, intent on seizing us.",
    "My Leader then took hold of me at once, even as a mother, by the noise aroused, and seeing close to her the burning flames, seizes her child and flees, and doth not stop, since caring more for him than for herself, even long enough to clothe her with a shift; and downward from the ridge of that hard bank, his back he yielded to the hanging rock, which closes one side of the following trench.",
    "Water ne'er moved as swiftly through a sluice, to turn the overshot wheel of a mill, when closest to the paddles it approaches,",
    "as did my Teacher o'er that selvage-bank, bearing me down with him upon his back, as though his son I were, and not his mate.",
    "His feet had hardly reached the trench's bed below, when they were on the ridge above, just over us; but naught was now to fear; because the Providence on high, which willed to place them in the fifth trench as its servants, takes from them all the power of leaving it.",
    "A painted people found we there below, who, moving with exceedingly slow steps, shed tears, and in their looks appeared subdued and weary.",
    "Cloaks they had equipped with cowls lowered before their eyes, and cut like those which in Cologne are fashioned for her monks.",
    "So gilded outside are they that they dazzle; but inside all are lead, and of such weight, that those which Frederick clothed men with were straw.",
    "O cloak that wearies through eternity!",
    "We turned again, as ever, to the left, along with them, intent on their sad plaint; but, owing to the weight, that weary folk came on so slowly, that new company we had at every motion of our legs.",
    "Hence to my Leader I: \"Contrive to find some one whom we may know by deed or name, and, while thus going, move thine eyes around.\"",
    "And one, who heard my Tuscan speech, cried out behind us: \"Stay your feet, O ye that run so quickly through the gloomy air! From me, perhaps, shalt thou receive what thou dost ask.\" Thereat my Leader turned and said: \"Now wait; and then proceed according to his pace.\"",
    "I stopped, and two I saw, whose faces showed great mental haste to be with me, and yet their burden and the narrow path delayed them.",
    "On coming up to us, they watched me long with eyes askance, and uttered not a word; then, toward each other turning, thus they spoke: \"This one seems by the action of his throat alive; but if they 're dead, by what right, then, go they uncovered by the heavy stole?\"",
    "And then, addressing me, they said: \"O Tuscan, who to the gathering of sad hypocrites art come, scorn not to tell us who thou art.\"",
    "And I to them: \"On Arno's lovely stream, and in its famous town, both born and bred, I'm in the body I have always had.",
    "But who are ye, adown whose cheeks there drips, as I perceive, so great a woe, and what the penalty which sparkles on you thus?\"",
    "\"These orange cloaks,\" one answered, \"are of lead, and of such thickness are they, that the weights thus cause the scales that balance them to creak.",
    "We Jovial Friars were, and Bolognese; I, Catalàn, and Loderingo he, by name, and chosen by thy town together, as one alone is usually called, to keep its peace; and such we were, as still in the Gardingo's neighborhood appears.\"",
    "\"O friars,\" I began, \"your evil deeds ...\"",
    "but said no more; because there struck mine eyes one crucified by three stakes on the ground.",
    "On seeing me, sighs through his beard he blew, and writhed all over; then Fra Catalàn, informed thereby of what had happened, said:",
    "\"The pinioned man thou gazest at, advised the Pharisees that it expedient was to torture one man for the people's sake.",
    "Stretched crosswise, as thou seest, on the road, and naked, he is forced to be the first to feel how much whoever passes weighs.",
    "And in like fashion suffer in this ditch his father-in-law, and others of the council which proved a seed of evil for the Jews.\"",
    "I then saw Virgil marvelling at him, who in the figure of a cross was stretched so basely in eternal banishment.",
    "Then to the friar he addressed these words: \"Be not displeased to tell us, an ye may, if on the right there lie a crossing-place,",
    "by means of which we two may issue hence, without black Angels being forced to come and extricate us from this trench's bed.\"",
    "\"Nearer than thou dost hope\" he then replied, \"a crag there is, which at the great round wall begins, and all the cruel trenches spans, save that at this one it is broken down, and spans it not; but ye can climb the ruins, which from its base lie piled along the slope.\"",
    "My Leader kept his head bowed down awhile; then said: \"Wrongly did he report the thing, who yonder grapples sinners with his hook!\"",
    "The friar then: \"Among the many vices given the Devil at Bologna, I once heard that he a liar is, and sire of lies.\"",
    "Thereat my Leader with great strides departed, somewhat disturbed by anger in his looks; then I the burdened left, and followed on behind the footprints of belovèd feet.",
    "When in the youthful season of the year the sun beneath Aquarius warms his locks, while southward now the nights pursue their way; and when the hoar-frost draws upon the ground the counterfeit of her white sister's face, though shortly lasts the temper of her pen; the peasant, lacking provender, gets up, looks out, and, seeing all the country white, slaps himself on the thigh, returns in doors, and walking to and fro, laments, poor wretch, not knowing what to do; then later on returning out again, recovers hope, on seeing that the world has shortly changed its face; and, taking down his shepherd-staff, out to their feeding drives his tender sheep.",
    "Even thus my Teacher filled me with dismay, when I beheld such trouble in his face; thus, too, the plaster quickly reached the wound; for when we had attained the ruined bridge, my Leader turned to me with that sweet look, which at the Mountain's foot I first perceived.",
    "First having well surveyed the ruined arch, after some counsel taken with himself, his arms he opened, and took hold of me.",
    "And like a man who ponders while he acts, and always seems to look ahead; ev'n so, while upward to the top of one great rock he pushed me, he sought out another crag, and said: \"Take hold of that one next, but first see whether it be fit to bear thy weight.\"",
    "No path was this for one who wore a cloak, since scarcely could we two, though he was light, and I was pushed, ascend from rock to rock.",
    "And had the slope on that bank not been shorter, than on the other, I know not of him, but I would surely have been overcome; but since the whole of Malebolgë slopes down to the opening of the lowest well, such is the nature of each trench's banks, that one is high, and low the following one; and yet we reached at length the ridge above, from which the crag's last rock projects.",
    "My breath was so exhausted from my lungs, when up at last, that I could go no further; nay, on arriving I sat down at once.",
    "\"Thus, henceforth, must thou rid thyself of sloth,\" my Teacher said; \"for one attains not fame, sitting on cushions, or 'neath canopies;",
    "and he that lives without attaining it, leaveth on earth such traces of himself, as smoke doth in the air, or foam in water.",
    "Therefore get up! O'ercome thy troubled breath with that soul-energy, which wins all fights, unless it sink beneath its body's weight! A longer stairway must be climbed; 't is not enough that these stairs have been left; if, then, thou understand me, let it profit thee.\"",
    "I thereupon arose, and showed myself better equipped with breath than I had felt, and said: \"Go on, for I am strong and bold!\"",
    "We took the pathway up along the crag, which rocky was, narrow and hard to climb, and steeper far than was the one before.",
    "Not to seem weak, I talked as on I went; this from the next trench caused a voice to come, which was incapable of forming words.",
    "Though I was on the summit of the arch which crosses here, I know not what it said; but moved to anger seemed the one who spoke.",
    "Downward I looked, and yet my living eyes could not attain the bottom for the dark; hence, \"Teacher, try to reach the following ridge,\" said I, \"and let us from the wall descend, for as I hear, but do not understand, so, looking down from hence, I make out nothing.\"",
    "\"No other answer give I thee,\" he said, \"save that of action; for a fair request ought to be met by deeds without a word.\"",
    "We climbed down from the bridge's further head, where to the eighth embankment it is joined, and then the trench was clearly shown to me; and in it I beheld a frightful throng of snakes, and of so weird a kind, that still the memory of them freezes up my blood.",
    "Let Libya and her sand no longer boast; for though she breed chel?dri, jàculi, with cenchri, phàreae and àmphisbaenae, ne'er with all Ethiopia did she show, nor e'en with what above the Red Sea lies, either so many or such evil plagues.",
    "Among this cruel and most dismal swarm people were running, nude and terrified, and with no hope of hole or heliotrope.",
    "Their hands were bound behind their back with snakes, whose tail and head were thrust between their loins, and tied together in a knot in front.",
    "Then lo, a serpent hurled himself at one, who near our bank was standing, and transfixed him there where the neck is to the shoulders joined.",
    "Never were o or i so quickly written, as he took fire, and, burning up, must needs turn wholly into ashes as he fell;",
    "whereat, though thus destroyed upon the ground, the dust, assembling of its own accord, turned instantly into the self-same man.",
    "So likewise, as great sages have declared, the Phoenix dies, and then is born again, as she approaches her five-hundredth year; she feeds through life on neither herbs or grain, but on amòmum only and incense-tears; her final swaddling bands are nard and myrrh.",
    "And as is he who falls, nor knoweth how, by demon force, which pulls him to the ground, or other inhibition binding man, and who, on getting up again, looks round wholly bewildered by the great distress which he has felt, and, as he looks, heaves sighs; such was that sinner, after he had risen.",
    "O Power of God, how truly just thou art, that in revenge dost deal such blows as these!",
    "Thereat my Leader asked him who he was, and he replied: \"Into this wild ravine I rained from Tuscany not long ago.",
    "Mule that I was, a beast's life, not a man's, I liked; I 'm Vanni Fucci, called the Beast; for me Pistoia was a worthy den.\"",
    "Then \"Tell him not to slip away,\" I said, \"and ask what fault thrust him down here; for I once saw in him a man of blood and strife.\"",
    "The sinner then, who understood, feigned not, but turned toward me both mind and face, and said, as with a sudden shame he colored up: \"That thou hast caught me in the misery in which thou see'st me, gives me greater pain than that which took me from the other life.",
    "I can't refuse what thou dost ask of me.",
    "I 'm placed thus low, because 't was I who robbed the vestry known for its fair ornaments; a deed once falsely put upon another.",
    "But now, lest thou enjoy this sight of me, if thou art ever out of these dark lands, thine ears to my announcement ope, and hear: Pistoia first despoils herself of Neri; then Florence changes folk and government.",
    "From Val di Magra Mars draws forth a bolt by turbid clouds enveloped; next, with wild and cruel storm, a battle will be fought upon the Picene Plain; then suddenly the bolt will cleave the mist in such a way, that every Bianco will thereby be wounded.",
    "And this I've said, that it may give thee pain!\"",
    "The thief, at the conclusion of his words, lifted his hands with both their figs, and cried: \"Take that, O God, for 't is to Thee I show them!\"",
    "From that time onward snakes have been my friends, for thereupon one coiled around his neck, as if to say: \"I 'd have thee speak no more;\" another, coiling, tied his arms together, and clinched itself so well in front of him, that he could make no use of them at all.",
    "Pistoia, ah, Pistoia, why not will to burn to ashes, and no longer last, since in ill-doing thou excell'st thy seed? In all of Hell's dark rings I 've seen no spirit so arrogant toward God; not even he, who fell down headlong from the walls at Thebes.",
    "Without another word he fled away; whereat I saw a Centaur full of rage come crying: \"Where, where is the stubborn soul?\" Not ev'n Maremma has so many snakes, I think, as on his crupper that one had, as far as where our human form begins.",
    "Upon his shoulders right behind his nape there crouched a dragon with wide opened wings; and he sets fire to whomsoe'er he meets.",
    "My Teacher said: \"He, yonder, Cacus is, who 'neath the rocks that form Mount Aventine oft made a lake of blood.",
    "He travels not along the road o'er which his brethren go, because of having fraudulently robbed the famous herd which he as neighbor had; this ended his sly deeds beneath the club of Hercules, who may perhaps have dealt him a hundred blows, whereof he felt but ten.\"",
    "While thus he spoke, that sinner, too, made off; whereat three spirits came and stood below us, whom neither I nor even my Leader noticed, until they all cried out: \"Who then are ye?\" because of which our conversation ceased, for afterward we heeded them alone.",
    "I knew them not; but so it happened then, as it is wont to do in certain cases, that one perforce employed another's name, saying: \"But where can Cianfa have remained?\" Hence, that my Leader might give heed, I placed my finger in a line from chin to nose.",
    "If thou art slow now, Reader, to believe what I shall tell, no marvel will it be, for I, who saw it, hardly grant I did.",
    "As toward them I was holding up my brows, lo, a six-footed serpent hurls itself in front of one, and clings to him all over; with both its middle feet it clasped his paunch, and with its fore feet seized upon his arms; then with its teeth it wounded both his cheeks; it spread its hind feet out along his thighs, and thrusting next its tail between the two, it stretched it upward all along his back.",
    "Ivy was never rooted to a tree so fast, as round about the other's limbs that horrible wild creature twined its own.",
    "And thereupon, as if hot wax they were, they stuck together, and their colors mixed, till neither seemed to be what it had been; just as a browish hue precedes the flame on burning paper which is not yet black, while, equally, the white part dies away.",
    "The other two looked on, and each exclaimed: \"O me, Agnello, what a change is thine! for see, thou now art neither two nor one.\"",
    "Already into one had both heads turned, when we two countenances still beheld mixed in a single face, where both were lost.",
    "From the four previous strips two arms were made; the thighs and legs, the belly and the chest became such members as were never seen.",
    "Cancelled therein was every former aspect; the transformed figure seemed both two and none; and thus appearing slowly moved away.",
    "As like a lightning-flash a lizard looks, if, changing hedges 'neath the dog-day's scourge, across a road it passes; even such a little fiery serpent seemed to me, as toward the bellies of the other two it came, livid and black as peppercorn.",
    "And in that part through which our nourishment is first received, it transfixed one of them, and then fell down, stretched out in front of him.",
    "The pierced man gazed at it, but nothing said; nay, firmly on his feet he stood, and yawned, as if attacked by fever or by sleep.",
    "He at the serpent looked, and it at him; one through his wound, the other through its mouth smoked hard, and each smoke with the other mingled.",
    "Let Lucan, then, be silent, where he tells of poor Sabellus' and Nassidius' fate, and, giving heed, hear what is now proclaimed.",
    "Of Cadmus, and of Arethusa, too, let Ovid cease to speak; for though his verse turn him into a snake, and make of her a fount, I grudge him not; for face to face he ne'er so changed two natures, that the forms of each were ready to exchange their matter.",
    "They blended each with each in such a way that, while the serpent fork-wise clove its tail, the wounded man together drew his feet.",
    "The legs and with them ev'n the very thighs so stuck together, that in little time their juncture left no mark that could be seen.",
    "The cloven tail was taking on the shape which there was being lost; the skin of one, meanwhile, was growing soft, and hard the other's.",
    "I saw his arms withdraw into his armpits, and both the serpent's feet, which were not long, lengthen as much, as those were growing short.",
    "And then its hinder feet, together twisted, became the member which a man conceals, while from his own the wretch had two thrust forth.",
    "And while the smoke was veiling both of them with novel hues, and generated hair on one side, and deprived of it the other, the one stood up, and down the other fell, nor turned aside for that the impious eyes, beneath which each of them was changing face.",
    "The one who stood, drew his in toward his temples; and from the excessive matter coming there ears issued on his undeveloped cheeks; and that, which ran not back, but was retained, of this superfluous matter, gave the face a nose, and thickened suitably its lips.",
    "He who was lying down thrusts forth his muzzle, and backward through his head withdraws his ears, even as a snail doth with its horns; his tongue, which single used to be, and prompt to speech, divides itself, while in the other case, the split one closes, and the smoking stops.",
    "The soul which had become a savage beast flees hissing through the trench; the other spits behind him as he talks.",
    "Then, having turned away from him his just created shoulders, he to the third said: \"I 'd have Buoso run, as I have, on his belly o'er this path.\"",
    "I thus beheld the seventh balast change and interchange; here let its novelty excuse me, if it slightly blur my pen.",
    "And though somewhat bewildered were my eyes, and though confused my mind, those men could not escape so secretly, that I should fail Pùccio Sciancato perfectly to see; and of the three companions who came first, he only was not changed; the other one was he, for whom, Gavillë, thou dost weep.",
    "Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great, that thou dost beat thy wings o'er sea and land, while ev'n through Hell thy name is spread abroad! Among the thieves five such as these I found, thy citizens, whence shame accrues to me, nor to great honor risest thou thereby.",
    "But if the truth be dreamed at dawn's approach, thou 'lt feel a little while from now what Prato, of others not to speak, is craving for thee; and were it now, it would not be too soon; so were it, then, since thus it needs must be! for it will grieve me more, the more I age.",
    "We went away, and up the flight of stairs, the bournes had formed for our descent before, my Teacher climbed again, and drew me with him; and as we followed up the lonely path among the rocks and boulders of the crag, our feet proceeded not without our hands.",
    "I sorrowed then, and now again I sorrow, when I direct my mind to what I saw, and curb my genius more than I am wont,",
    "lest it should run when virtue guides it not; that, if a kindly star, or aught that's better, have blest me, I myself may not regret it.",
    "As many glow-worms as the countryman, — who on the hillside takes his rest, when he, who lights the world, least hides his face from us, while to the gnat the fly is giving way, — sees down along the valley where, perchance, he gathers in his grapes, or ploughs his field; with just as many flames the whole eighth trench was gleaming bright, as I perceived at once, when I was where its bottom came in view.",
    "As he who by the bears avenged himself, beheld Elijah's chariot when it left, and when to heaven its horses rose erect, since he could not so trace it with his eyes, as to see more than just the flame alone, when like a little cloud it rose on high; of such a nature were the flames that moved along the gulley of the ditch, for none displays its theft, though each a sinner hides.",
    "Risen up to look, I so stood on the bridge, that without being pushed I would have fallen, had I not grasped a great projecting rock.",
    "My Leader, who perceived me thus intent, then said: \"The spirits are within the fires, and each is swathed by that wherewith he burns.\"",
    "\"My Teacher,\" I replied, \"I 'm more assured through hearing thee, but deemed it so already, and wished to ask thee: ‘Who is in the flame which comes along so cloven at the top, that from the pyre it seems to rise, whereon Etèocles was with his brother placed?'\"",
    "He answered me: \"Therein are both Ulysses and Diomed tormented, who in pain thus go together, as they did in wrath; and in that flame of theirs they now bewail the ambush of the horse, which made the gate, from which the Roman's noble seed went forth; there they lament the trick, because of which Deidamaa, dead, still mourns Achilles; there the Palladium's penalty is paid.\"",
    "\"If they can speak within those sparks,\" said I, \"I pray thee, Teacher, much, and pray again that mine be worth to thee a thousand prayers, refuse not my request to linger here until the horned flame come this way; thou see'st that toward it I 'm inclined by great desire.\"",
    "And he replied to me: \"Thy prayer deserves much praise and therefore I accede to it, but see thou that thy tongue restrain itself.",
    "Leave speech to me, who have a clear idea of what thou wouldst; for they, since Greeks they were, might be, perchance, disdainful of thy words.\"",
    "After the flame had come so near to us, that time and place seemed fitting to my Leader, 't was in this fashion that I heard him speak:",
    "\"O ye that in a single flame are two, if I deserved of you, when still alive, if I deserved of you or much or little, when in the world I wrote the lofty verses, depart not; but let one of you inform us whither, when lost, he went away to die.\"",
    "The greater horn then of the ancient flame began to quiver with a murmuring sound, as would a flame made weary by the wind; and then, while swaying here and there its tip, as if the latter were the tongue that spoke, gave forth a voice, and said: \"When I departed from Circe, who concealed me near Gaeta more than a year before Aeneas so had named the place, nor fondness for my son, nor pious reverence for my agèd father, nor ev'n the bounden love which should have cheered Penelope, could overcome within me the eagerness I had to gain experience both of the world, and of the vice and worth of men; but forth I put upon the deep and open sea with but a single ship, and with that little company, by whom I had not been deserted.",
    "Both its shores I then beheld, as far away as Spain, Morocco and the island of the Sards, and all the rest that sea bathes round about.",
    "Both old and slow were I and my companions, when we attained that narrow passage-way, where Hercules set up those signs of his, which warned men not to sail beyond their bounds; Seville I left behind me on the right hand, Ceuta I'd left already on the other.",
    "And then I said: O brothers, ye who now have through a hundred thousand perils reached the West, to this so short a waking-time still left your senses, will not to refuse experience of that world behind the sun which knows not man! Bethink you of the seed whence ye have sprung; for ye were not created to lead the life of stupid animals, but manliness and knowledge to pursue.'",
    "So eager for the voyage did I make my fellows by this little speech of mine, that, after it, I hardly could have checked them.",
    "Hence, to the morning having turned our stern, we with our oars made wings for our mad flight, e'er veering toward the left as on we sped.",
    "Night was already seeing all the stars of the other pole, and our pole so low down, that from the ocean's floor it never rose.",
    "Five times rekindled, and as often quenched, had been the light beneath the moon, since first we entered on the passage of the deep, when lo, a mountain loomed before us, dim by reason of the distance, and so high it seemed to me, that I had seen none such.",
    "And we rejoiced; but soon our happiness was turned to grief; for from the new-found land a whirlwind rose, and smote our vessel's prow; three times it made her whirl with all the waters; then at the fourth it made her stern go up, and prow go down, even as Another pleased, till over us the ocean's waves had closed.\"",
    "The flame, because of having ceased to speak, was quiet and erect, and now away from us was going with the gentle Poet's leave; when lo, another, which behind it came, caused us to turn our eyes up toward its tip, by reason of a vague sound issuing thence.",
    "As the Sicilian bull (which bellowed first with the lament of him, and that was right, who with his file had given form to it,) was wont to bellow with the voice of him who suffered in it, so that, though of brass, it seemed the one who by the pain was pierced; even so, since from the body of the flame they had nor path nor mouth, the painful words were changed at first into the latter's tongue.",
    "But when these words had travelled to the tip, and given it that vibration which the tongue, when uttered, gave to them, we heard it say:",
    "\"O thou, to whom I now address my voice, and who just now didst talk in Lombard, saying: ‘Now go thy way, for thee I urge no more;'",
    "though I, perhaps, have somewhat late arrived, be not displeased to stop and speak with me; thou see'st that I am not, although I burn! If into this blind world thou only now art fallen down from that sweet Latin land, whence all my guilt I bring, pray tell me whether the Romagnoles are having peace or war; for I came from the mountains 'tween Urbino and that high peak from which the Tiber springs.\"",
    "While downward I was leaning still intent, my Leader touched me on my side, and said: \"Speak thou, for this one an Italian is.\"",
    "And I, who had my answer all prepared, began to speak without delay: \"O soul, that art concealed down yonder, thy Romagna is not at present, and she never was, devoid of war within her tyrants' hearts; but I left none apparent there just now.",
    "Ravenna is, as she for many years has been; Polenta's eagle so broods there, that Cervia it o'ercovers with its wings.",
    "The town which made the long resistance once, and of the French a sanguinary heap, beneath the green paws finds itself again.",
    "Verrucchio's former Mastif and the new, who foully with Montagna dealt, there make, where they are wont, a gimlet of their teeth.",
    "The cities of Lamone and Santerno the little lion of the white lair rules, who changes sides from summer-time to winter; and that whose flank is by the Savio bathed, lives, as it sits twixt plain and mount, a free state half, and half a tyranny.",
    "And now, I pray thee, tell me who thou art, nor harder be than others here have been, so may thy name maintain itself on earth.\"",
    "After the flame had roared a little while, as is its fashion, to and fro it moved its pointed tip, and then gave forth this breath:",
    "\"If I believed that my reply were made to one who to the world would e'er return, this flame would stay without another quiver; but inasmuch as, if I hear the truth, none e'er returned alive from this abyss, fearless of infamy I answer thee.",
    "A man of arms I was, then Cordelier, trusting, since girded thus, to make amends; and certainly my trust had been confirmed, were 't not for that High Priest, (whom ill befall!) who set me at my former sins again; both how and why I 'd have thee hear from me.",
    "While I was still the shape of bones and flesh my mother gave me, my performances were not a lion's, but a fox's deeds.",
    "All covert practices and hidden ways I knew; and I so carried on their arts, that to the ends of earth their fame was noised.",
    "When I perceived at last that I had reached that period of my life, when each should strike his sails and coil his ropes, what hitherto had given me pleasure I thereat disliked; I yielded then, repenting and confessing, and that, alas, poor me! would have availed.",
    "The Prince of modern Pharisees, who then hard by the Lateran had a war on hand, though not with either Saracens or Jews, for Christian were all enemies of his, and none of them had gone to conquer Acre, or been a merchant in the Soldan's land; not heeding in himself his lofty office and holy orders, or in me the cord, which leaner used to make those girt therewith; but as upon Soracte Constantine once bade Sylvester heal his leprosy; so this one called on me, as master-leech, to cure him of the fever of his pride; he asked me for advice, but I kept still, because his words were like a drunkard's words.",
    "And then he said: ‘Let not thy heart mistrust; I from now on absolve thee; teach me, then, how I can Palestrina overthrow.",
    "To lock and unlock Heaven is in my power, as thou dost know; two, therefore, are the Keys, my predecessor held in small esteem.' His weighty words then drove me to the point, at which the silent course appeared the worse; ‘Father,' I therefore said, ‘since from the sin thou washest me, which I must now commit, a promise long drawn out but shortly kept will cause thy triumph on the lofty seat.' Then Francis came for me, when I was dead; but one of our black Cherubs said to him: ‘Remove him not, and do no wrong to me! Among my menials he must needs descend, because he gave the fraudulent advice, since which till now I 've had him by the hair; for who repents not cannot be absolved, nor yet can one at once repent and will, the contradiction not permitting it!' O woeful me! O how I shook with fear, when, after laying hold on me, he said: ‘Perhaps thou didst not think me a logician!' He carried me to Minos, and the latter round his hard back eight times entwined his tail, and when in great rage he had bitten it, ‘A sinner of the thievish fire is this,' he said; hence, where thou see'st me, I am lost, and, thus robed, sorrowing go my way.\"",
    "When he had thus completed his discourse, the flame departed from us with its grief, twisting and lashing its sharp-pointed horn.",
    "I and my Leader then passed further on up o'er the crag, as far as the next arch which spans the ditch, wherein their due is paid to those who burdens win by severing bonds.",
    "Who ever could, ev'n with unfettered words, tell fully of the blood and of the wounds which now I saw, though oft he told the tale? All tongues would certainly fall short of it, by reason of our speech and of our mind, whose means are small for taking in so much.",
    "If all the people should again assemble, who on Apulia's fortune-ravaged soil suffered of old from all the loss of blood shed by the Trojans, and in that long war, which with its spoil of rings made such high heaps, as Livy writes, who maketh no mistakes; with those who felt the painful force of blows received in waging war with Robert Guiscard, and those whose bones are still heaped up together at Ceperano, where a faithless liar was each Apulian, and near Tagliacozzo, where old Alardo won, though all unarmed; and if, of these, one showed a limb pierced through, and one a limb lopped off, 't would all be nothing, compared with this ninth trench's foul display.",
    "No cask, indeed, by loss of middle-board or stave, is opened as was one I saw, split from the chin to where one breaketh wind; while down between his legs his entrails hung, his pluck appeared, and that disgusting sack, which maketh excrement of what is swallowed.",
    "While I on seeing him was all intent, he looked at me, and opening with his hands his breast, he said: \"See now how I am cloven! Behold how torn apart Mahomet is! Ali in tears moves on ahead of me, cloven in his face from forelock down to chin; and all the others whom thou seest here disseminators were, when still alive, of strife and schism, and hence are cloven thus.",
    "There is a devil here behind, who thus fiercely adorns, and to the sword's edge puts each member of this company anew, when we have gone around the woeful road; because, ere one return in front of him, the wounds thus made have all been closed again.",
    "But who art thou, that musest on the crag, perhaps to put off going to the torture adjudged thine accusation of thyself?\"",
    "\"Death hath not reached him yet,\" replied my Teacher, \"nor to a torment is he led by guilt, but that complete experience may be giv'n him,",
    "I, who am dead, must needs conduct him here from circle unto circle down through Hell; and this is true, as that I speak to thee.\"",
    "On hearing him, more were there than a hundred who stopped there in the ditch to look at me, and who through their surprise forgot their pain.",
    "\"To Fra Dolcino do thou therefore say, thou that, perhaps, wilt shortly see the sun, if soon he would not hither follow me, to arm him so with food, lest stress of snow should give the Novarese a victory, which else would not be easily obtained.\"",
    "When one foot he had raised to go away, Mahomet said these words to me; which done, upon the ground he stretched it to depart.",
    "Another then, who had his neck pierced through, his nose cut off as far as 'neath his brows, and who had one ear only, having stopped to gaze in wonder with the others there, opened, before the rest, his throat, whose neck vermilion was on every side, and said:",
    "\"O thou that by thy guilt art not condemned, and whom up in the Latin land I 've seen, unless too great resemblance play me false, call Pier da Medicina to thy mind, if e'er thou see again the lovely plain, which from Vercelli slopes to Marcabò.",

    "Between the isles Majolica and Cyprus Neptune ne'er saw so great a crime committed by pirates, nay, nor by the Argolic folk.",
    "That traitor who sees only with one eye, and holds the town, from seeing which, one now is with me here, who fain would fasting be, will to a conference have them come with him; he 'll then so act, that 'gainst Focara's wind they 'll stand in need of neither vow nor prayer.\"",
    "And I to him: \"Point out and show to me, if news of thee thou 'dst have me bear above, which is the one who had the bitter sight.\"",
    "Thereat he laid his hand upon the jaw of one of his companions, oped his mouth, and cried: \"This is the one, for he speaks not; when exiled, he removed all doubt in Caesar, by saying that a man, when once prepared, ne'er brooked delay but to his detriment.\"",
    "Oh, how dismayed that Curio seemed to me, who from his throat now had his tongue cut out, yet once had been so daring in his speech!",
    "Then one, from whom both hands had been lopped off, raising his maimed arms through the gloomy air, so that his blood befouled his face, cried out: \"Mosca will thou remember, too, who said, alas! ‘What 's done is done!' a speech which proved the seed of evil for the Tuscan race.\" \"And death\" I thereto added, \"to thy tribe!\" Then he, as woe on woe he heaped, went off, as one would whom his grief had made insane.",
    "But I remained to look upon the throng, and such a thing I saw as I should be afraid to tell of without further proof; if it were not that conscience reassures me, the good companion which, beneath the breastplate of conscious purity, emboldens man.",
    "I really saw, and still I seem to see it, a trunk without a head, which moved along, as moved the others of the mournful herd; and by the hair it held the severed head, which, hanging like a lantern from its hand, was saying as it gazed at us: \"O me!\" With his own self he made himself a lamp, and two in one they were, and one in two; how this can be, He knows who so ordains.",
    "When at the bridge's very foot he was, he raised his arm above him, head and all, that he might thus bring near to us his words,",
    "which were: \"Now see my baneful punishment, thou that, though breathing, go'st to see the dead! See whether any be as great as this! And that thou with thee mayst bear news of me, know that Bertran de Born I am, the man who gave the youthful king the ill support.",
    "Of sire and son I mutual rebels made; Ahithophel by Absalom and David, with his malicious goadings, did no more.",
    "Because I severed those who thus were joined, I bear my brain around with me, alas! severed from its foundation in this trunk; retaliation thus is seen in me.\"",
    "The many people and unheard-of wounds had caused my eyes to be so drunk with tears, that fain they were to linger there and weep; but Virgil said: \"At what art gazing still? Why is it that thine eyes still rest down there among the wretched mutilated shades? Thou didst not thus when in the other trenches; consider, then, if thou propose to count them, that this trench circles two-and-twenty miles, and that the moon is now beneath our feet; short is the time allowed us still, and more there is to see, than what thou seest here.\"",
    "\"If thou hadst heeded\" I thereat replied, \"the reason for my gazing there, thou wouldst, perhaps, have granted me a longer stay.\"",
    "Meantime my Leader on his way was going, and I behind him moving, as I made my answer, adding: \"In that hollow place, whereon I kept mine eyes so steadily, I think a spirit sprung from mine own blood bewails the fault so dearly paid for there.\"",
    "Thereat my Teacher said: \"Let not thy thoughts hereafter break on him; heed other things, and there let him remain; for at the foot of that small bridge I saw him point thee out, and with his finger fiercely threaten thee; Geri del Bello I then heard him called.",
    "So wholly wast thou then intent on him who formerly possessed Hautefort, that thou, till he departed, didst not look beyond.\"",
    "\"Leader,\" said I, \"his death by violence, which is not yet avenged for him by any who shared the shame, made him indignant; that, as I believe, was why he went away without addressing me; he thus has caused me to pity him the more.\" We thus conversed till we had reached the first place on the crag, whence, had there been more light, the next ravine had to its very bottom been revealed.",
    "When we o'er Malebolgë's final cloister were situated so, that its lay-brethren could be perceived by us, uncouth laments, which had their arrow-heads with pity barbed, so pierced me through and through, that with my hands I closed mine ears.",
    "Such pain as there would be, if from the hospitals of Val di Chiana, Maremma and Sardinia, from July until September, all diseases came",
    "together in one ditch; such was it here; and out of it there came a stench, like that which out of rotting limbs is wont to come.",
    "Adown the last bank of the lengthy crag we went, as ever to the left; and then much clearer was my vision toward the bottom, wherein the servant of the Most High Lord, Justice infallible, is punishing the falsifiers she recordeth here.",
    "I do not think it were a sadder sight to see the whole race in Aegina sick, when so suffused with poison was the air, that all the animals, down to the little worm, fell dead, and when the ancient race of people, according to what poets hold for truth, out of the seed of ants restored themselves; than now it was, to see the spirits languish down in that gloomy ditch in different heaps.",
    "One on his belly lay, and others leaned against each other's shoulders, while another crawled on all fours along the dismal path.",
    "Without conversing, step by step we moved, both looking at and listening to the sick, who could not raise their bodies.",
    "Two of these I then saw sitting and against each other leaning, just as a pan against a pan is leaned to warm, and spotted o'er with scabs",
    "from head to foot; and never have I seen a curry-comb plied by a boy, for whom his master waited, or by one who kept awake against his will, as each oft plied upon himself the edge of finger-nails for the great rage of itching, which hath else no help; their nails kept scraping down their scabs, as doth a knife the scales of bream, or fish of other kinds equipped with larger scales.",
    "\"O thou that with thy fingers flay'st thyself,\" to one of them my Leader then began, \"and who at times dost pincers make of them, pray tell us whether Latin any be of those in here, so may thy nails suffice thee for thy work eternally.\"",
    "\"We, both of us, whom thou beholdest here so spoiled, are Latin,\" answered one who wept, \"but who art thou that didst inquire of us?\"",
    "My Leader thereupon said: \"I am one who with this living man from ledge to ledge descend, and who propose to show him Hell.\"",
    "Thereat the common back was broken up, and trembling each of them turned round toward me, with others who had heard him by rebound.",
    "Then my good Teacher drew close up to me, and said: \"Say whatsoe'er thou wilt to them.\" Hence, since he so had wished it, I began:",

    "But so that thou mayst know who backs thee thus against the men of Siena, point thine eyes toward me, that well my face may answer thee; so shalt thou see that I 'm Capocchio's shade, who metals falsified by alchemy; and thou, if well I see thee, shouldst recall how good an ape of nature I was once.\"",
    "When Juno, on account of Semele, was angry with the royal blood of Thebes, as several times she showed herself to be, so fiercely mad did Athamas become, that, when he saw his wife approaching him, burdened by her two sons on either side, \"Spread we the nets,\" he cried, \"that I may take, upon their passing, lioness and cubs!\" and thereupon stretched out his cruel claws, and taking hold of one, Learchus named, whirled him around, and dashed him 'gainst a rock; his wife then with the other drowned herself.",
    "Again, when Fortune so low down had brought the Trojans' arrogant, all-daring power, that with their kingdom shattered was their king; Hecuba, sad, forlorn, and captive now, when she had seen her dead Pol?xena, and in her painful anguish had perceived her Polydorus lying on the beach, out of her senses, barked as would a dog; so greatly had her suffering turned her mind.",
    "But ne'er did furies or of Thebes or Troy reveal in any one such cruelty, in goading beasts or, much less, human limbs, as that which I beheld in two death-pale and naked shades, who ran around, and bit, as doth a boar, when from the sty let out.",
    "One reached Capocchio, and so thrust his tusks into his neck behind, that, dragging him, he made his belly scrape the solid ground.",
    "The Aretine, still trembling, said to me: \"That imp is Gianni Schicchi who, enraged, goes all around ill-treating others thus.\" Then \"Oh,\" said I to him, \"so may the other not fix his teeth in thee, be not too tired to tell me who he is, before he ‘skips'!\"",

    "The heavy dropsy which unmates the limbs in such a way with ill-digested humor, that face and paunch no longer correspond, was causing him to keep his lips apart, as doth the hectic, who, because of thirst, turns one lip chinward, and the other up.",
    "\"O ye that are, and wherefore I know not, free from all torment in this world of woe,\" said he to us, \"behold, and pay attention to Master Adam's wretched misery! When living, I had all that I desired, and now, alas, I crave a drop of water.",

    "And one of them, who felt aggrieved, perhaps, at being named so darkly, smote the speaker upon his hard stiff belly with his fist.",
    "It made a sound, as it had been a drum; then Master Adam smote him with his arm, which did not seem less hard, upon his face, and said: \"Though I of motion be deprived, by reason of my limbs which heavy are, I have an arm that 's loose for needs like this.\"",
    "Then he replied: \"When going to the fire thou hadst it not so ready; but just so, and more, thou hadst it, when thou madest coin.\"",
    "He of the dropsy: \"Here thou sayest true, but thou wast not so true a witness there, where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.\"",
    "\"If I spoke falsely, thou didst falsify the coin!\" said Sinon, \"I 'm for one sin here, and thou for more than any other demon!\"",
    "\"Remember, perjurer, the horse,\" replied he of the swollen paunch, \"and bitter be for thee, that known it is by all the world!\"",
    "\"Ill be for thee the thirst wherewith thy tongue is cracking,\" said the Greek, \"and that foul water, which 'fore thine eyes thus makes thy paunch a hedge!\"",
    "Thereat the coiner said: \"As is its wont, thy mouth in speaking evil gapeth wide; for though I 'm thirsty, and humor stuffs me out, thine is the fever and the aching head; and thou 'dst not stand in need of many words bidding thee lick the mirror of Narcissus.\"",
    "On listening to them I was all intent, when \"Now be careful there!\" my Teacher said, \"for I 'm not far from quarrelling with thee.\"",
    "When I thus heard him speak to me in anger, such was the shame wherewith I turned to him, that through my memory it is circling still; and such as he who dreameth of his harm, and, dreaming, wishes that he dreamt, and thus, as if it were not, longs for that which is; such I became, who, impotent to speak, would fain excuse myself, and all the while was doing so, but did not think I was.",
    "\"Less shame would wash away a greater fault than thine hath been;\" my Teacher said to me, \"therefore unburden thee of all thy sadness, and count on me as ever at thy side, if it again should chance that Fortune find thee where folk in such a wrangle are engaged; for vulgar is the wish to hear such things.\"",
    "One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me, so that it colored both my cheeks, and then supplied me with the medicine required; Achilles' and his father's lance, I hear, was likewise wont to be the source of, first, a sad, and, after, of a grateful gift.",
    "We turned our backs upon the woeful vale over the bank which girds it round about, and passed across without a single word.",
    "Here less than night it was, and less than day, so that my sight advanced not far; but here I heard a horn give forth so loud a sound, that it had rendered any thunder faint; this led mine eyes, as counter to its path they followed, wholly to a single place.",
    "After the woeful rout, when Charlemagne the holy army of his knights had lost, Roland blew not so terrible a blast.",
    "I had not kept my head turned toward it long, when many lofty towers I seemed to see; I, therefore: \"Teacher, say what town is this?\"",
    "\"Since through the darkness from too far away thou peerest,\" he replied, \"it comes about that afterward thou errest in conceiving.",
    "If yonder thou attain, thou 'lt clearly see how from afar one's senses are deceived; hence onward urge thyself a little more.\"",
    "Thereat he took my hand with kindly care, and said to me: \"Ere further on we go, so that the fact may seem less strange to thee, know, then, that towers they are not, but Giants; and all of them are standing in the well around the bank, each from his navel down.\"",
    "As, when a fog is thinning off, one's gaze little by little giveth shape to that, which, since it packs the air, the mist conceals; even so, as through the dense, dark air I pierced, and nearer drew and nearer to the brink, error in me took flight, and fear increased; for, as upon its round enclosing walls Montereggione crowns itself with towers; thus o'er the margin which surrounds the well with one half of their bodies towered up those frightful Giants, whom, when from the sky he thunders, Jupiter is threatening still.",
    "Already now was I distinguishing the face of one, his shoulders and his breast, most of his paunch, and, down his sides, both arms.",
    "When Nature ceased from making animals like these, and took such executioners from Mars, she certainly did very well; and ev'n if she of elephants and whales repent her not, whoever subtly looks holds her therein the more discreet and just; for where the reasoning faculty is joined to evil will equipped with power to act, people can make against it no defence.",
    "His face appeared to me as long and big as is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's, and in proportion to it were his other bones; so that the bank, which from his middle down an apron was, showed quite so much of him above it, that of reaching to his hair three Frisians would have made a useless boast; for I full thirty spans of him perceived, down from the place at which one buckles cloaks.",
    "\"Rafel mai amech zabi et almi\" the frightful mouth, to which no sweeter psalms were fitting, thereupon began to cry.",
    "Then toward him cried my Leader: \"Foolish soul, keep to thy horn, and vent thyself therewith, when wrath or other passion seizes thee! Search at thy neck, and thou wilt find the cord which holds it tied, O spirit of confusion, and see it lying on thy mighty breast.\"",
    "To me then: \"Self-accused he stands, for this is Nimrod, to whose evil thought is due that more than one tongue in the world is spoken.",
    "Let us leave him alone, nor talk in vain; for such is every tongue to him, as his to others is, for that is known to none.",
    "Then, turning to the left, we travelled on much further; and within a crossbow's shot we found the next one far more large and fierce.",
    "What was the master's power who girded him, I cannot say; but this one had in front his left arm, and behind his back his right, tied by a chain, which downward from his neck held him so bound, that on the uncovered part it wound around as far as the fifth coil.",
    "My Leader said to me: \"'Gainst Jove Most High this proud soul wished to test his strength, and hence hath this reward.",
    "Ephialtes is his name; his haughty undertaking he attempted what time the Giants caused the Gods to fear; the arms he plied he moveth now no more.\"",
    "And I to him: \"If possible it be, I 'd gladly have these eyes of mine enjoy experience of the measureless Briareus.\"",
    "Then he replied: \"Antaeus thou 'lt behold not far from here, who speaks, and, since unbound, can set us at the bottom of all sin.",
    "He is much further on, whom thou wouldst see, and bound he is, and shaped like this one, save that more ferocious in his looks he seems.\"",
    "There never was an earthquake strong enough to shake a tower with so much violence, as Ephialtes quickly shook at this.",
    "Then more than ever yet did I fear death, nor for it was there need of more than fear, had it not been that I perceived his bonds.",
    "We thereupon proceeded further still, and to Antaeus came, who full five ells, beside his head, protruded from the pit.",
    "\"O thou that in the valley fortune-blest, which once caused Scipio to inherit glory when with his followers Hannibal took flight, once tookst a thousand lions as thy prey, and who, hadst thou been at thy brethren's war on high, it seems that it is still believed the Sons of Earth had been the victors there; pray set us down below, nor let disdain affect thee, where the cold locks up Cocytus.",
    "Make us not go to Tatyus or to Tapheus; this man can give what most is longed for here; stoop, then, nor twist thy muzzle.",
    "He can still give fame to thee on earth, since he is living, and still looks forward to long life, if Grace recall him not untimely to itself.\"",
    "The Teacher thus; then he in haste stretched out the hands, whose mighty pressure Hercules once felt, and took my Leader.",
    "Virgil then, on feeling himself taken, said to me: \"Come here, that I may take thee up;\" and then so did, that he and I one bundle were.",
    "Such as the Carisenda seems, when viewed beneath its leaning side, whene'er a cloud sails o'er it so, that opposite it hangs; such did Antaeus seem to me, who watched to see him stoop, and such a moment 't was, that I had gladly gone another road.",
    "But lightly at the bottom, which devours Judas and Lucifer, he set us down; nor, thus bent over, did he linger there, but raised himself, as on a ship a mast.",
    "If I had rhymes that were as harsh and hoarse as would be fitting for the dismal hole, on which lean all the other circling rocks, I 'd squeeze the juice of my conception out more fully; but because I have them not, not without fear do I resolve to speak; for to describe the bottom of the universe is not an enterprise wherewith to jest, nor for a tongue that says ‘mamma' and ‘dad'; let, then, those Ladies give my verse their aid, who helped Amphion build the walls of Thebes, that from the facts the telling differ not.",
    "O rabble, that, ill-born beyond all people, are in a place, to speak of which is hard, far better had ye here been sheep or goats!",
    "When we were down within the gloomy well, beneath the Giant's feet, though lower far, and I still gazing at its lofty wall, I heard one say to me: \"Look where thou walkest! and see that with thy feet thou trample not the heads of us two wretched, weary brothers!\"",
    "Thereat I turned around, and saw before me, and 'neath my feet, a lake which, being frozen, seemed to be made of glass and not of water.",
    "The Danube up in Austria never made so thick a veil in winter for its course, nor yonder 'neath the cold sky did the Don, as what was here; for even if Tambernich had fallen on it, or had Pietrapana, it had not cracked even at its very edge.",
    "And as a frog remains, to do its croaking, with muzzle out of water, in the season when oft the peasant dreams that she is gleaning; even so, as far as where one's shame is shown, the woeful shades were livid in the ice, as to the notes of storks they set their teeth.",
    "Each kept his face turned downward; from his mouth, the cold, and from his eyes, his saddened heart provides itself a witness in their midst.",
    "When I had gazed around a while, I looked down at my feet, and two I saw with heads so close together, that their hair was mixed.",
    "\"Ye that are pressing thus your breasts together, say who ye are,\" said I.",
    "They bent their necks, and when their faces had been raised toward me, their eyes, moist only inwardly before, gushed upward though the lids; whereat the cold, binding the tears between them, closed them up.",
    "A clamp ne'er bound so tightly board to board; whereat, so great the anger mastering them, like two he-goats, they butted one another.",
    "And one who had, by reason of the cold, lost both his ears, with face still lowered, said: \"Why dost thou mirror thee so much on us? If thou wouldst know who those two near thee are, the valley from which thy Bisenzio flows belonged to their sire Albert and to them.",
    "They issued from one body; and thou canst search through all Caana, but thou 'lt never find a shade more worthy to be fixed in ice; not he, whose breast and shadow broken were by one same blow at Arthur's hand; nor yet Focaccia; nor this fellow here, whose head so blocks me, that I cannot see beyond, and who was Sàssol Mascheroni called; who he was, thou, if Tuscan, now knowst well.",
    "And that thou put me to no further speech, know, then, that I was Camiciòn de' Pazzi, and that, to excuse me, I await Carlan.\"",
    "Thereafter I beheld a thousand faces made doglike by the cold; hence frozen ponds cause me to shudder now, and always will.",
    "And now, while toward that center we were moving, whereto all heavy objects gravitate, and I was trembling in the eternal cold;",
    "I know not whether it were will, or fate, or chance; but as I walked among the heads, hard in the face of one I struck my foot.",
    "Weeping he scolded: \"Wherefore dost thou smite me? Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance for Mont' Aperti, why dost thou molest me?\"",
    "And I said: \"Teacher, wait now for me here, that I through him may issue from a doubt; then at thy pleasure shalt thou hurry me.\"",
    "My Leader stopped; and I to him, who still was savagely blaspheming, said: \"What sort of man art thou, that scoldest people so?\"",
    "\"Now who art thou, that goest\" he replied, \"through Antenora, smiting cheeks so roughly, that it would be too much, wert thou alive?\"",
    "\"I am alive, and it may profit thee\" was my reply, \"for me to place thy name, if fame thou ask, among my other notes.\"",
    "And he: \"I crave the contrary; away with thee, and bother me no more; for ill dost thou know how to flatter in this bog!\"",
    "Thereat I seized him by the nape, and said: \"It needs must be that thou reveal thy name, or that no hair remain upon thee here!\"",
    "Then he to me: \"Though thou pull out my hair, I 'll neither say, nor show thee, who I am, fall thou upon my head a thousand times.\"",
    "I had his hair wrapped round my hand already, and more than one shock had I plucked from him, while he was barking, with his eyes turned down; when here another cried: \"What ails thee, Bocca? Is making noise with jawbones not enough, unless thou bark? What devil touches thee?\"",
    "\"Henceforth\" said I, \"I would not have thee speak, perfidious traitor; for true news of thee I 'll carry with me to thy lasting shame.\"",
    "\"Begone, and tell whate'er thou wilt;\" he answered, but be not silent, if thou issue hence, of him who had just now his tongue so ready.",
    "He here bewails the money of the French; ‘Him of Duera' thou canst say, ‘I saw where cold the days are for the sinful folk.' And if thou shouldst be asked who else was there, thou hast beside thee him of Beccheraa, who had his gorget cut in two by Florence.",
    "Gianni de' Soldanier is further on, I think, with Ganellon, and Tebaldello, who, while its people slept, unlocked Faenza.\"",
    "From him we had departed now, when two I saw, so frozen in a single hole, that one man's head served as the other's cap.",
    "And as because of hunger bread is eaten, even so the upper on the other set his teeth, where to the nape the brain is joined.",
    "Not otherwise did Tydeus gnaw the temples of Menalippus out of spite, than this one was gnawing at the skull and other parts.",
    "\"O thou that showest by a sign so beastly hatred toward him thou eatest, tell me why,\" said I to him, \"on this express condition, that shouldst thou rightfully of him complain, I, knowing who ye are, and that one's sin, may quit thee for it in the world above, if that, wherewith I speak, be not dried up.\"",
    "From his grim meal that sinner raised his mouth, and wiped it on the hair of that same head, which he had spoiled behind.",
    "He then began: \"Thou wouldst that I renew a hopeless grief, the thought of which already breaks my heart, before I speak of it.",
    "But if my words are likely to be seeds, and bear the fruit of infamy upon the traitor whom I gnaw, speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.",
    "I know not who thou art, nor by what means thou 'rt come down here, but when I hear thee speak, thou truly seemst to me a Florentine.",
    "Know, then, that I Count Ugolino was, and this man here Ruggieri, the Archbishop; and now I 'll tell thee why I 'm thus his neighbor.",
    "That, as the outcome of his evil thoughts, I, trusting him, was seized, and afterward was put to death, there is no need to say; but that which thou canst not have heard, that is, how cruel was my death, thou now shalt hear, and whether he have wronged me thou shalt know.",
    "A narrow slit within the moulting-tower, which bears, because of me, the name of Hunger, and in whose walls still others must be locked, had through its opening shown me many a moon already, when I had the evil dream, which rent apart the curtain of the future.",
    "This one therein a lord and huntsman seemed, chasing the wolf and wolfings toward the mount which hinders Pisans from beholding Lucca, with bitches lean and eager and well trained; for he had set before him in his van Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfranchi.",
    "After a little run both father and sons seemed weary to me; then methought I saw their flanks torn open by sharp-pointed fangs.",
    "When, just before the morning, I awoke, I heard my children, who were with me there, sob in their sleep, and ask me for their bread.",
    "Cruel indeed thou art, if, thinking what my heart forebode, thou grievest not already; and if thou weepest not, at what art wont to weep? Awake they were, and now the hour was drawing nigh when food was brought to us, hence each, by reason of his dream, was worried; and then I heard the dread tower's lower door nailed up; whereat, without a word, I looked my children in the face.",
    "I did not weep, so like a stone had I become within; they wept; and my poor little Anselm said: ‘Father, thou lookest so! What aileth thee?' But still I did not weep, nor did I answer through all that day, or through the following night, till on the world another sun had dawned.",
    "Then, when a little beam had made its way into our woeful prison, and I perceived by their four faces, how I looked myself, I bit in anguish both my hands.",
    "And they, thinking it done because I craved to eat, immediately stood up, and said to me: ‘Father, much less shall we be pained, if us thou eat; thou with this wretched flesh didst clothe us, do thou, then, strip it from us now.' Thereat, to sadden them no more, I calmed myself; through that day and the next we all kept mute.",
    "Ah, why, hard earth, didst thou not open up?",
    "Then Gaddo, when the fourth day we had reached, stretched himself out at length before my feet, and said: \"My father, why dost thou not help me?\" And there he died; and, ev'n as thou seest me, between the fifth day and the sixth I saw the three fall one by one; and, blind already, I gave myself to groping over each, and two days called them, after they were dead; then fasting proved more powerful than pain.\"",
    "When he had spoken thus, with eyes awry, he seized again the wretched skull with teeth, which for the bone were strong as are a dog's.",
    "Ah, Pisa, foul reproach of those that dwell in that fair country where the sa is heard; since slow thy neighbors are to punish thee, then let Caprara and Gorgona move, and make a hedge across the Arno's mouth, that every person in thee may be drowned! for though Count Ugolino had the name of traitor to thee in thy castle-towns, thou shouldst not thus have crucified his sons.",
    "Their youthful age had made, thou modern Thebes, Brigata and Uguccione innocent, and the other two my canto names above.",
    "Further along we went, to where the ice roughly enswathes another class of people, not downward turned, but wholly on their backs.",
    "Weeping itself allows not weeping there, and tears, which find a barrier in their eyes, turn back, to cause their suffering to increase; because the first ones form a solid block, and thus like crystal visors wholly fill the hollow cup beneath the brow.",
    "And though, as in a callous spot, because of cold all feeling had departed from my face,",
    "it seemed to me that now I felt some wind; whence I to him: \"My Teacher, who moves this? Is not all moving air quenched here below?\"",
    "And he: \"Ere long shalt thou be where thine eyes, seeing the cause which raineth down the blast, will make an answer to thee as to this.\"",
    "One of the wretches of the icy crust called out to us thereat: \"O souls, so cruel, that unto you the last place is assigned, remove for me the hard veils on my face, that I may somewhat vent the pain that fills my heart, before the tears freeze up again.\"",
    "Whence I to him: \"If thou wouldst have me help thee, say who thou art; and should I not relieve thee, may I needs reach the bottom of the ice!\"",
    "Then he: \"I Frate Alberigo am, he of the evil garden's fruit, who here for every fig I gave get back a date.\"",
    "Then \"Oh!\" said I, \"art thou already dead?\" And he to me replied: \"I have no knowledge how in the world above my body fares.",
    "Such is the privilege of this Ptolomèa, that frequently a soul falls into it, ere Atropos have caused it to move on.",
    "But that thou scrape more gladly from my face these glassy tears, know, then, that just as soon as any soul betrays, as I betrayed,",
    "its body is taken from it by a demon, who then takes charge of it, until its time be all revolved.",
    "Into a well like this it rushes headlong down; and so, perhaps, the body of the shade that winters here behind me, is still visible above.",
    "This thou shouldst know, if just come down, for he Ser Branca d' Oria is, and many years have now gone by, since he was thus shut up.\"",
    "\"I think\" said I, \"that thou deceivest me, for Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet, but eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and dons his clothes.\"",
    "\"Above us, in the Malebranche's ditch,\" he said, \"there, where the sticky pitch is boiling, not yet had Michel Zanche's soul arrived, when in his stead this fellow left behind a devil in his body, as did also one of his kinsmen, who with him performed the treachery.",
    "But stretch thy hand here now, and ope mine eyes!\" And yet I oped them not, for rudeness shown to him was courtesy.",
    "Ah, Genoese! ye men estranged from all morality, and full of every vice, why from the earth are ye not wholly driven? for with the meanest spirit of Romagna, I found one such of you, that, for his deeds, in soul he bathes already in Cocytus, and seems in body still alive above.",
    "\"The banners of the King of Hell advance toward us; now, therefore, look ahead of thee,\" my Teacher said, \"and see if thou perceive him.\"",
    "As, when a heavy fog is breathed abroad, or when at night our hemisphere grows dark, a windmill looks when seen from far away; even such a structure seemed I now to see; then, for the wind, I shrank behind my Leader, for other shelter was there none.",
    "I now — and 't is with fear I put it into verse, — was where the shades were wholly covered up, and visible as is a straw in glass; some lying are; and some are standing up, one on his head, the other on his soles; one, like a bow, bends toward his feet his face.",
    "When we had gone so far ahead, that now it pleased my Teacher to reveal to me the Creature who once seemed so beautiful, he stepped from where he was in front of me, stopped me, and said: \"Lo Dis, and lo the place, where thou must arm thyself with fortitude!\"",
    "How frozen and how weak I then became, ask thou not, Reader, for I write it not, because all speech would be of small avail.",
    "I did not die, nor yet remained alive; think for thyself now, hast thou any wit, what I became, of both of these deprived.",
    "The Emperor of the Realm of Woe stood forth out of the ice from midway up his breast; and I compare more closely with a Giant, than merely with his arms the Giants do; consider now how great that whole must be, that with such parts as these may be compared.",
    "If, once as beautiful as ugly now, he still raised up his brows against his Maker, justly doth every woe proceed from him.",
    "Oh, what a marvel it appeared to me, when I beheld three faces to his head! One was in front of us, and that was red; the other two were to the latter joined right o'er the middle of each shoulder-blade, and met each other where he had his crest; that on the right twixt white and yellow seemed; the left one such to look at, as are those who come from there, where valeward flows the Nile.",
    "Under each face two mighty wings stretched out, of size proportioned to so huge a bird; sails of the sea I never saw so large.",
    "They had no feathers, but were like a bat's in fashion; these he flapped in such a way, that three winds issued forth from him; thereby Cocytus was completely frozen up.",
    "With six eyes he was weeping, and his tears and bloody slaver trickled o'er three chins.",
    "In each mouth, as a heckle would have done, a sinner he was crushing with his teeth, and thus was causing pain to three of them.",
    "To him who was in front of us the biting was nothing to the clawing, for at times his back remained completely stripped of skin.",
    "\"That soul up there which hath the greatest pain Judas Iscariot is,\" my Teacher said, \"who hath his head within, and plies his legs without.",
    "Of the other two, whose heads are down, Brutus is he who from the black snout hangs; see how he writhes, and utters not a word! Cassius the other is, who so big-limbed appears.",
    "But night is coming up again, and now 't is time to leave, for we 've seen all.\"",
    "Then, as it pleased him, I embraced his neck, and he availed himself of time and place, and when the wings were opened wide enough, he firmly grasped the shaggy flanks, and then from tuft to tuft he afterward descended between the matted hair and frozen crusts.",
    "When we were come to where the thigh turns round, just at the thick part of the hips, my Leader with tiring effort and with stress of breath turned his head round to where his legs had been, and seized the hair as one would who ascends; hence I thought we were going back to Hell.",
    "\"Hold fast to me, for by such stairs as these\" panting like one worn out, my Teacher said, \"must such great wickedness be left behind.\" Then, through an opening in the rock he issued, and, after seating me upon its edge, over toward me advanced his cautious step.",
    "Raising mine eyes, I thought that I should still see Lucifer the same as when I left him; but I beheld him with his legs held up.",
    "And thereupon, if I became perplexed, let those dull people think, who do not see what kind of point that was which I had passed.",
    "\"Stand up\" my Teacher said, \"upon thy feet! the way is long and difficult the road, and now to middle-tierce the sun returns.\"",
    "It was no palace hallway where we were, but just a natural passage under ground, which had a wretched floor and lack of light.",
    "\"Before I tear myself from this abyss, Teacher,\" said I on rising, \"talk to me a little, and correct my wrong ideas.",
    "Where is the ice? And how is this one fixed thus upside down? And in so short a time how hath the sun from evening crossed to morn?\"",
    "Then he to me: \"Thou thinkest thou art still beyond the center where I seized the hair of that bad Worm who perforates the world.",
    "While I was going down, thou wast beyond it; but when I turned, thou then didst pass the point to which all weights are drawn on every side; thou now art come beneath the hemisphere opposed to that the great dry land o'ercovers, and 'neath whose zenith was destroyed the Man, who without sinfulness was born and died; thy feet thou hast upon the little sphere, which forms the other surface of Judecca.",
    "'T is morning here, whenever evening there; and he who made our ladder with his hair, is still fixed fast, ev'n as he was before.",
    "He fell on this side out of Heaven; whereat, the land, which hitherto was spread out here, through fear of him made of the sea a veil, and came into our hemisphere; perhaps to flee from him, what is on this side seen left the place empty here, and upward rushed.\"",
    "There is a place down there, as far removed from Beelzebub, as e'er his tomb extends, not known by sight, but by a brooklet's sound,",
    "which flows down through a hole there in the rock, gnawed in it by the water's spiral course, which slightly slopes.",
    "My Leader then, and I, in order to regain the world of light, entered upon that dark and hidden path; and, without caring for repose, went up, he going on ahead, and I behind, till through a rounded opening I beheld some of the lovely things the sky contains; thence we came out, and saw again the stars.",
    "To run o'er better water hoists her sails the little vessel of my genius now, which leaves behind her such a cruel sea; and of that second Realm I 'll sing, wherein the human spirit purifies itself, and groweth worthy to ascend to Heaven.",
    "But here let Poetry arise from death, since, holy Muses, yours I am; and let Calliopë, here somewhat higher soaring, with those sweet tones accompany my song, whose power the miserable Magpies felt so keenly, that of pardon they despaired.",
    "The oriental sapphire's tender hue, now gathering in the sky's unclouded face, as far as to the first of circles pure, began again to give mine eyes delight, when forth I issued from the deadly air, which with its gloom had filled mine eyes and heart.",
    "The beauteous planet which incites to love, veiling with light the Fishes in her train, was causing all the eastern sky to laugh.",
    "Round to the right I turned, and set my mind upon the other pole, and saw four stars, never perceived, save by the first of men.",
    "The sky appeared to enjoy their little flames.",
    "O region of the North, that widowed art, because deprived of gazing thereupon!",
    "When I had from the sight of them withdrawn, turning a little toward the other pole, whence now the Wain had wholly disappeared, a lone Old Man beside me I perceived, deserving of such reverence in his looks, that no son owes his father any more.",
    "Long was the beard he wore, and partly white, as likewise was the hair upon his head, two locks of which hung down upon his breast.",
    "And so the rays of those four holy stars adorned his face with splendor, that to me course he looked as if the sun were facing him.",
    "\"Who, then, are ye, that 'gainst the blind stream's have from the eternal Prison escaped?\" he said, moving the while those venerable locks.",
    "\"Who led you, or what served you as a lamp, when forth ye issued from the night profound, which makes the infernal Vale forever black? Are broken thus the laws of Hell's abyss, or through new counsel is there change in Heaven, that ye, though damned, are come to these my cliffs?\"",
    "My Leader thereupon took hold of me, and with his words and with his hands and signs imposed respect upon my legs and brow.",
    "He then replied: \"I came not of myself; from Heaven came down a Lady, at whose prayer I helped this man with my companionship.",

    "Not yet hath this man his last evening seen; but through his folly was so near to it, that he was left but very little time.",
    "As I have told thee, I was sent to save his life; nor was there any other way than this, to which I have addressed myself.",
    "I 've shown him all the people who are guilty; and now I mean those spirits to reveal, who 'neath thy jurisdiction cleanse themselves.",
    "Long would it take to tell thee how I led him; virtue descendeth from on high, which helps me lead him to see thee and to hear thee speak.",
    "His coming, therefore, please to welcome; Freedom he seeks, which is so dear, as knoweth he who gives up life therefor.",
    "This thou dost know, since death for its sake was not bitter to thee in Utica, where thou didst leave the robe, which on the Great Day will so brightly shine.",
    "The eternal edicts are not void through us; for this man lives, and I 'm not bound by Minos; but of that circle am, wherein the eyes of thy chaste Marcia are, O holy breast, whose looks implore thee still to hold her thine; for love of her, then, yield thee unto us! Permit us through thy seven domains to go.",
    "My grateful praise of thee I 'll bear to her, if to be mentioned there below thou deign.\"",
    "\"Marcia so pleased mine eyes,\" he then replied, \"that, while upon the other side I was, I granted all the favors she desired.",
    "Now that she dwells beyond the evil stream, no longer can she move me, by the law made at the moment when I issued thence.",
    "But if a Lady of Heaven impel and guide thee, as thou hast said, no need of flattering prayers; suffice it thee that for her sake thou ask.",
    "Go, then, and see that with a leafless rush thou gird this man, and that thou wash his face, so that therefrom all foulness thou remove; for 't were not fit he went, with eyes o'ercast by any mist, before the first of those who serve as Ministers of Paradise.",
    "This little isle around its lowest base, down yonder where the waves are beating it, produces rushes on its yielding ooze.",
    "No other plant, like one that brought forth leaves, or hardened, can maintain its life down there, because it yields not when receiving blows.",
    "Thereafter be not hither your return; the sun, which rises now, will show you how to climb the Mountain by the easiest slope.\"",
    "Thereat he disappeared; and I arose without a word, and to my Leader's side I closely drew, and toward him turned mine eyes.",
    "And he began: \"Son, follow thou my steps; let us turn backward, for the shore slopes down on this side toward its lowly boundaries.\"",
    "The dawn was vanquishing the morning breeze, which fled before it, so that, from afar, I recognized the shimmering of the sea.",
    "We now were going o'er the lonely plain, as one who to a road he lost returns, and, till he find it, seems to go in vain.",
    "When we were there, where with the sun the dew still struggles on, through being in a place where, for the breeze, it slowly melts away, my Teacher, having spread out both his hands, rested them gently on the tender grass; whence I, who of his purpose was aware, yielded to him the cheeks my tears had stained; he then brought all that natural color back, which Hell had on my countenance concealed.",
    "We came thereafter to that lonely shore, which never saw its waters sailed by one who afterward experienced a return.",
    "Here, as the other pleased, he girded me.",
    "O wondrous sight! For, like the humble plant which he had chosen, another instantly sprang forth again from where he tore the first.",
    "And now already had the sun arrived at that horizon, whose meridian circle rests with its zenith o'er Jerusalem; and Night, which circles opposite thereto, was issuing from the Ganges with the Scales, which, when she gains, are falling from her hands; so that the white and pure vermilion cheeks of beautiful Aurora, where I was, were turning orange through excessive age.",
    "Along the seaside we were lingering still, like folk who, taking thought about their road, go on in heart, but with their body stay; when lo, as, at the approach of morning, Mars, because of heavy vapors, groweth red down in the West above the ocean's floor; even so I saw — may I again behold it! — a light which o'er the sea so swiftly moved, that no flight is as rapid as its motion; from which when I a moment had withdrawn mine eyes, to ask a question of my Leader, again I saw it grown more bright and large.",
    "And on each side of it there then appeared I knew not what white thing, and underneath little by little came another forth.",
    "Meanwhile my Teacher uttered not a word until the first white objects looked like wings; then, having recognized the Pilot well, he cried: \"See, see now that thou bend thy knees! This is God's Angel; fold thy hands! Henceforth shalt thou behold such officers as this.",
    "See how he so scorns human instruments, as to wish neither oar, nor other sail than his own wings, between such distant shores! See how he holds them straight up toward the sky, stroking the air with those eternal plumes, which do not moult as mortal feathers do!\"",
    "And then, as more and more the Bird divine drew near to us, the brighter he appeared; therefore mine eyes endured him not near by, but down I cast them; with a little boat he came ashore, so agile and so light, the water swallowed up no part of it.",
    "Such on its stern the heavenly Pilot stood, that he would bless one, were he but described; more than a hundred spirits sat within.",
    "\"When Israel out of Egypt came,\" they all in unison were singing there together, with what is written after in that psalm.",
    "Then, having signed them with the holy Cross, whereat all cast themselves upon the shore, he went away as swiftly as he came.",
    "The crowd which stayed seemed strangers to the place, and gazed around them there, as doth a man, who with unwonted things acquaints himself.",
    "The sun, which from the middle of the sky had hunted Capricorn with arrows bright, was shooting forth the day on every side, when those new people raised their brows toward us, and said: \"If ye know how, point out to us the road that one should take to reach the Mount.\"",
    "And Virgil answered: \"Ye, perchance, believe that we have had experience of this place; but we are pilgrim-strangers like yourselves.",
    "We came just now, a little while before you, but by another way, so rough and hard, that going up will now seem play to us.\"",
    "The souls who, by my breathing, had become aware that I was still a living being, in their astonishment turned death-like pale; and as around a messenger who bears the olive, people surge to hear the news, and, as to crowding, none of them seem shy; so one and all those fortune-favored souls fixed on my face their gaze, as if forgetting to go and make their spirits beautiful.",
    "Then one among them I beheld advance, in such a loving manner, to embrace me, that it persuaded me to do the like.",
    "O, save in your appearance, empty shades! Three times behind it did I clasp my hands, and to my breast therewith as oft returned.",
    "With wonder, I believe, I painted me; smiling because of this, the shade drew back, while, following after, I pressed further on.",
    "With gentle words he told me to desist; then who it was I knew, and begged of him to stop a little while and speak with me.",
    "\"As thee I loved, when in my mortal body,\" he answered me, \"even so, when freed, I love thee; therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?\"",
    "\"Casella mine,\" said I, \"I take this journey, that where I am I may return again; but why from thee hath so much time been taken?\"",
    "And he to me: \"No outrage hath been done me, if he, who takes both when and whom he likes, hath more than once refused me passage here; for to a Righteous Will is his conformed; yet peacefully, these three months, hath he taken whoever wished to enter into his boat.",
    "Hence I, who now was toward the sea-shore bent, where Tiber's water mingles with the salt, was with benignity received by him",
    "at yonder river's mouth, toward which his wings ev'n now are turned; for those who go not down toward Acheron, always assemble there.\"",
    "And I: \"If some new law take not from thee the memory or the practice of the song of love, which used to quiet all my longings, be pleased a little to console therewith my spirit, which, because of coming here when in its body, is so sore distressed!\"",
    "\"The love that talketh with me in my mind,\" he thereupon began to sing so sweetly, that still within me is its sweetness heard.",
    "My Teacher, I, and those that with him were, seemed as contented, as if none of us had any other thing upon his mind.",
    "Absorbed in listening to his notes, we all were motionless; when lo, the grave Old Man, who cried: \"Ye laggard spirits, what is this? What means this negligence and standing still? Run to the Mount, and strip ye off the slough, which lets not God be visible to you.\"",
    "Ev'n as, when picking grains of wheat or tares, doves, met together at their feeding, calm, and not displaying their accustomed pride, if anything appear that frightens them, all of a sudden leave their food alone, because assailed by greater cause for care;",
    "even so I saw that new-come family give up the song, and toward the hillside move, like one who goes, but whither knoweth not; nor was in less haste our departure made.",
    "Although their sudden flight had scattered them over the plain, and turned them toward the Mount, where Justice probes us with its penalties, more closely to my faithful mate I drew.",
    "And how without him had I run my race, or who had drawn me up the Mountain's side?",
    "To me he seemed o'erwhelmed with self-reproach.",
    "O conscience, when both dignified and clear, how sharp a bite a slight fault is to thee!",
    "When once his feet had given up the haste, which of their dignity deprives all acts, my mind, to one thought limited at first, enlarged its scope with eager interest now; and toward that Mountain I addressed my gaze, which skyward rises highest from the sea.",
    "The sun, which back of us was flaming red, in front of me was broken in the shape wherein I lent its rays a resting place.",
    "I turned, and at my side I looked, afraid of having been abandoned, when I saw the ground was dark in front of me alone.",
    "When wholly turned, my Comforter began: \"Why still distrustful? Dost thou not believe that I am with thee, and am guiding thee? 'T is evening now where buried lies the body, wherein I cast a shadow; Naples now possesses it; from Brindisi 't was taken.",
    "If, then, in front of me no shadow fall, marvel no more than at the heavenly spheres thou wouldst, which hinder not each other's rays.",
    "That Power enables bodies such as mine to suffer torments, both of heat and cold, which wills not that Its ways be shown to us.",
    "Insane is he that hopes our human reason will ever travel o'er the boundless path, o'er which One Substance in three Persons moves.",
    "Be satisfied, O human race, with facts; for if ye could have seen the cause of all, no need had been for Mary to bear child; and ye 've seen, vainly longing, men so great, that their desire would else have been appeased, which giv'n them is for an eternal grief; I speak of Aristotle and of Plato, and many others.\" Here he bowed his head, and, saying nothing more, remained disturbed.",
    "Meanwhile we had attained the Mountain's foot; and there we found the rocky cliff so steep, that legs would there be nimble all in vain.",
    "'Tween Lèrici and Turbaa the loneliest and wildest path is, if compared with that, a safely climbed and easy flight of stairs.",
    "\"Now who knows on which side the hill so slopes,\" then said my Teacher, as he stayed his steps, \"that he who wingless goes can make the ascent?\"",
    "Meanwhile, as he was questioning his mind about the path, and held his face bowed down, and I was gazing upward round the cliff, upon my left a throng of souls appeared, who toward us moved their feet, yet did not seem to move, so slowly were they coming on.",
    "\"Teacher,\" said I, \"lift up thine eyes; behold on this side people who will give us counsel, if thou canst not obtain it from thyself.\"",
    "He then looked up, and with relief replied: \"Let us go toward them, for they slowly come, and thou, sweet son, be steadfast in thy hope.\"",
    "Those people were as yet as far away, after a thousand of our steps, I mean, as a good thrower's hand would reach, when all pressed up against the lofty bank's hard mass, and stayed there, still, and huddled up together, as, when in doubt, a walker stops to look.",
    "Virgil began: \"O ye whose end was good, O now elected spirits, by the peace which I believe ye all look forward to,",
    "say where the Mount so lies, that going up be possible for us; for loss of time, to him who knoweth most, is most displeasing.\"",
    "As from the fold young sheep are wont to come by ones, and twos, and threes, while timidly the others stay, with downcast eyes and muzzle; and what the first one doth, so do the rest, all huddling up to her, in case she stop, simple and quiet, nor yet knowing why; even so the leader of that favored flock I saw start forward then, and toward us come, modest in face and dignified in gait.",
    "When those who were in front the light beheld so broken on the ground upon my right, that 'gainst the cliff a shadow fell from me, they stopped, and backward drew a little way; and all the others coming on behind, not knowing why they did so, did the same.",
    "\"Without your asking I affirm to you that this you see a human body is; therefore the sun's light on the ground is broken.",
    "Be not surprised, then, but believe that not without a power that cometh down from Heaven, is he attempting to surmount this wall.\"",
    "My Teacher thus; those worthy people then, as with the back part of their hands they waved, said: \"Turn, then, and ahead of us go in.\"",
    "And one of them began: \"Whoe'er thou art, as thus thou goest, turn thy face! Recall if thou hast ever seen me in the world.\"",
    "Toward him I turned, and on him fixed my gaze.",
    "Blond, handsome, and of noble mien he was, although an eyebrow by a blow was cut.",
    "When I had with due modesty disclaimed having e'er seen him there, he said: \"Now see!\" and showed me high upon his breast a wound.",
    "Then with a smile he said: \"Manfred am I, the grandson of the Empress Constance; hence I beg thee that, on thy return, thou go to my fair daughter, mother of the honor of Sicily and Aragon, and should aught else be told her, tell her thou the truth.",
    "After my body by two mortal stabs had been pierced through, in tears I gave myself to that One who forgiveth willingly.",
    "My sins were horrible, indeed; and yet the Goodness Infinite hath arms so wide, that It receiveth all who turn to It.",
    "And if Cosenza's Pastor, who by Clement was sent to hunt me down, had then perused this page in God's book, as he should have done, my body's bones would still be lying there, hard by the bridge's head near Benevento, under the keeping of the heavy cairn.",
    "Bathed by the rain, the wind now blows them round outside the Kingdom, near the Verde's banks, whither he moved them with extinguished lights.",
    "Not by their cursing is Eternal Love so lost, that it can not return again, as long as hope hath still a speck of green.",
    "'T is true that he that dieth in contempt of Holy Church, though at the very last he may repent, outside this Mountain's bank must stay, for all the time that he hath been in his presumption, thirty times as long, unless by good prayers shortened be this ban.",
    "See now if thou canst make me glad, by telling my good Costanza both where thou hast seen me and of this interdict; for one is here greatly advanced by those that are beyond.\"",
    "Whene'er, because of pleasure or of pain received by any faculty of ours, our soul is wholly centered thereupon, it seems to heed no other faculty; and this is 'gainst that wrong belief which holds that one soul in us o'er another burns.",
    "Therefore, when anything is heard or seen, which toward it holds the soul intently turned, time passes by, and one perceives it not; since one thing is the faculty which harks, and that which holdeth all the soul another; this last is bound, as 't were, the former free.",
    "Of this I real experience had, while hearing and wondering at that spirit; for the sun had climbed up fifty full degrees at least, though I had not perceived it, when we came to where those souls cried out to us together: \"The place which you were asking for is here.\"",
    "Oft doth a farmer, when the grapes grow dark, close up a wider opening in a hedge with but a little forkful of his thorns,",
    "than was the entrance there, through which my Leader, and I behind him, mounted all alone, when once the crowd had gone away from us.",
    "One climbs Sanlèo, and descends to Noli; one wins the summit of Bismàntova, helped solely by one's feet; but one up here would have to fly; with the swift wings, I mean, and plumes of great desire, behind the Guide, who gave me hope and furnished me with light.",
    "As up within the cloven rock we climbed, its walls on each side closely hemmed us in, while under us the ground both feet and hands required.",
    "When on the high cliff's upper edge we were, and out upon the open slope, \"Which way, my Teacher, shall we go?\" said I.",
    "And he to me: \"Take thou no backward step; keep gaining ground behind me up the Mount, until some guide who knows appear to us.\"",
    "So high the summit was, that it surpassed our sight, and steeper far the slope, than were a line from center to mid-quadrant drawn.",
    "Weary was I, when I began to speak: \"O gentle Father, turn around, and see how I remain alone, unless thou stop!\"",
    "\"Draw thyself up, my son, as far as there!\" he said, and somewhat higher pointed out a ledge on that side circling all the hill.",
    "His words so spurred me, that I forced myself to crawl behind him on my hands and knees, until the girding ledge was 'neath my feet.",
    "There both of us sat down, and faced the East, whence we had made the ascent; for looking back upon a traversed course is wont to help.",
    "First to the shores below I turned mine eyes; then raised them to the sun, and was amazed that we were smitten by it on our left.",
    "The Poet well perceived that I was gazing dumbfounded at the chariot of the light, which now was rising 'tween the North and us.",
    "\"If Castor\" said he then to me, \"and Pollux were in the company of yonder mirror, which up and down in turn conducts its light, thou wouldst the Zodiac's ruddy part behold revolving still more closely to the Bears, unless it issued from its ancient path.",
    "If thou wouldst understand how this can be, collect thy thoughts within thee, and imagine both Zion and this Mount so placed on earth, that both of them one sole horizon have, and different hemispheres; and thou wilt see how that the road which Phaëthon could not take, alas for him, must pass this Mount on one, while passing that one on the other side, if thine intelligence but clearly heed.\"",
    "\"Surely, my Teacher, never have I seen\" said I, \"as clearly as I now perceive, where once my mind appeared to be at fault, how the mid-circle of supernal motion, which in a certain art is called Equator, and ever 'tween the sun and winter stays, lies toward the North, for reasons giv'n by thee, as far on this side as the Hebrew people ever beheld it toward the heated parts.",
    "But, if it please thee, I would gladly know how far we have to go; because the Mount higher ascends than eyes of mine can rise.\"",
    "\"Such is this Mountain\" said he then to me, \"that, always hard to climb at first below, it pains one less, the higher one ascends.",
    "Hence, when so pleasant to thee it shall seem, that going up shall be to thee as easy as floating with the current in a boat, thou then shalt have attained this pathway's end.",
    "Hope there to rest thee from thy breathless toil! No more I answer; this I know for truth.\"",
    "When he had ended what he had to say, the voice of one near by cried out: \"Perhaps, ere that shall happen, thou wilt need to sit!\"",
    "On hearing this, we both of us turned round, and saw a massive boulder on our left, which neither I nor he had seen before.",
    "Thither we drew; and there some persons were, who lingered in the shade behind the rock, as one is wont to do through indolence.",
    "And one of them, who weary seemed to me, was sitting with his arms around his knees, and down between the latter held his face.",
    "\"O my sweet Lord,\" said I then, \"turn thine eyes on yonder man, who shows himself to be more lazy than if sloth his sister were!\"",
    "Then turning round toward us, and giving heed, he moved his face no more than o'er his thigh, and said: \"Go up now, thou that active art!\"",
    "I then knew who it was; nor did the strain, which quickened still my breath a little, hinder my going to him; yet, when at his side I was, he barely raised his head, and said: \"Hast thou at last seen why it is the sun driveth his car o'er thy left shoulder here?\"",
    "His lazy actions and his few short words impelled my lips to smile a little; then, \"Belacqua,\" I began, \"I grieve for thee no more; but tell me why thou sittest here? Art waiting for a guide, or hast thou now merely resumed thy customary mood?\"",
    "And he: \"What, brother, is the use of climbing? The Bird of God who at the Gate is seated, would not allow me to approach the pangs.",
    "The sky must first turn round me here outside, as long as ever in my life it did, since I delayed good sighs until the end, unless before then I be helped by prayers arising from a heart that lives in grace; of what avail are those unheard in Heaven?\"",
    "But now the Poet, climbing on ahead, was saying: \"Come now on with me! Thou see'st that our meridian by the sun is touched, and that already from the Ganges' banks Night covers up Morocco with her feet.\"",
    "Already had I parted from those shades, and in my Leader's steps was following on, when one behind me, pointing with his finger, cried out: \"See how the light seems not to shine upon the left side of that lower man, who seems to act like one that's still alive!\"",
    "Hearing this speech, I turned mine eyes, and saw that with astonishment they gazed at me, at me alone, and at the broken light.",
    "\"Why is thy mind so sore perplexed,\" then said my Teacher, \"that thou slackenest thy pace? What carest thou for what is whispered here? Follow thou me, and let the people talk! Firm as a tower remain, which never shakes its top, however hard the winds may blow! For from himself he ever turns his mark, in whom one thought wells up behind another, for each of them impairs the other's strength.\"",
    "What could I say in answer, save \"I come\"? And this I said, tinged slightly with the color which sometimes makes one worthy of forgiveness.",
    "Meanwhile a little way ahead of us some people crosswise o'er the slope were coming, singing the Miserere verse by verse.",
    "When they became aware that through my body I gave no passage to the rays of light, they changed their chant into a long, hoarse \"Oh!\" and two of them, acting as messengers, ran out to meet us, and enquiring said: \"Cause us to know what kind of life is yours.\"",
    "My Teacher answered: \"Ye may go your way, and unto those that sent you out report that real flesh this man's body is.",
    "And if, as I suppose, they stopped because they saw his shadow, they 've been answered well enough; if they respect him, it may profit them.\"",
    "I never saw ignited vapors cleave at nightfall an unclouded sky, or break so rapidly from August clouds at sunset, that these returned not up in shorter time; and, once there, with the rest they veered toward us, as would a troop that ran without a curb.",
    "\"These people who are crowding us are many,\" the Poet said, \"and come to beg of thee; therefore go on, and listen on thy way.\"",
    "\"O soul, that goest to be glad\" they cried, as on they came, \"with those limbs which thou hadst when thou wast born, a little stay thy steps!",
    "Recall if thou hast e'er seen one of us, that yonder thou mayst carry news of him! Why, pray, dost thou go on? Ah, why not stop? We all were slain of old by violence, and sinners were until our latest hour; then light from Heaven so caused us to beware, that we, repentant and forgiving, issued from life at peace with God, who in our hearts stirs us with grievous longings to behold Him.\"",
    "And I: \"Howe'er I gaze upon your faces, none do I recognize; and yet, if aught within my power can please you, well-born souls, ask it, and I will do it, by the peace, which, following the feet of such a Guide, hath now become my quest from world to world.\"",
    "And one began: \"Each trusts in thy good help without an oath, provided lack of power cut not thy good will short.",
    "Hence I, who speak alone before the others, beg of thee, if e'er thou see the country which extends between Romagna and the land of Charles, be courteous to me with thy prayers in Fano, that supplications due be made for me, to help me purge away my grievous sins.",
    "It was from there I came; but those deep wounds, whence flowed the blood wherein my life resided, were giv'n me in the Antenori's lap,",
    "where I had trusted I should be most safe.",
    "The lord of Esti, who was angry with me beyond the bounds of justice, had it done.",
    "Yet toward La Mira had I only fled, when at Oriàgo I was overtaken, still yonder would I be, where people breathe.",
    "Toward the lagoon I ran, whose reeds and mire so hampered me, I fell; and there a pool formed from my veins I saw upon the ground.\"",
    "Then said another: \"So may that desire, which draws thee to the lofty Mount be granted, with kindly pity, prithee, help thou mine! I Montefeltro was, I am Buonconte; Giovanna cares not for me, nor do others; hence among these I go with head bowed down.",
    "And I to him: \"What force was it, or chance, caused thee to stray so far from Campaldino, that never hath thy burial-place been known?\"",
    "\"Oh!\" he replied, \"A river called Archiàno flows crosswise at the Casentino's foot, and takes its rise among the Apennines, above the Hermitage.",
    "There, where its name is lost, I came, a fugitive on foot, pierced through the throat, and staining with my blood the plain.",
    "And there it was I lost my sight, and ended speech with Mary's name; and there I fell, and all alone my flesh remained.",
    "The truth I tell, tell thou among the living.",
    "God's Angel took me, while the one from Hell cried out: ‘Why dost thou rob me, thou from Heaven? Thou bearest hence this man's eternal part, because of one small tear which takes him from me; but I shall with the rest deal otherwise!' Well knowst thou how damp vapors in the air, as soon as they ascend to where the cold affects them, into water change again.",
    "He joined that wicked will, which asks for naught but evil, with intelligence, and stirred the mists and wind, by power his nature gave.",
    "The valley thereupon, when day was spent, he covered o'er with fog from Pratomagno up to the mountain-chain, and made the sky so lowering o'er it, that the pregnant air to water turned; the rain poured down, and what the soil absorbed not, reached the rivulets; then, having joined the torrent-brooks, it rushed so swiftly toward the royal stream, that naught could hold it back.",
    "The swift Archiàno then hard by its outlet found my frozen body; and, as it swept it on into the Arno, loosened the cross which with my arms I made upon my breast, when sorrow's pain o'erwhelmed me; along its banks and bed it rolled me on; then covered me, and wrapped me with its spoils.\"",
    "\"Prithee, when to the world thou hast returned, and when from thy long journey thou art rested,\" after the second spirit said the third, \"do thou remember me, who Pia am! Sièna made me; Maremma me unmade; he knoweth what this means, who previously had, in betrothal, ringed me with his gem.\"",
    "Whene'er a game of dice is broken up, the one who loses sorrowing stays behind, and learns, as sadly he repeats the throws; while with the other all the people leave; one goes before, one grasps him from behind, and at his side one asks to be remembered.",
    "And he stops not, but that one heeds and this; the one whose hand he takes no longer crowds; and from the throng he thus defends himself.",
    "E'en such as he, was I in that dense crowd; for as I this and that way turned my face, and promised each, I freed myself therefrom.",
    "Here was the Aretine who met his death from Ghin di Tacco's cruel arms, and he, who running madly in pursuit was drowned; here Frederick Novello prayed with hands outstretched, and he of Pisa, who induced worthy Marzucco to reveal his strength.",
    "Count Orso I beheld here, and the soul through spite and envy from its body parted, and not, so he maintained, through crime committed;",
    "Pierre de la Brosse, I mean; and here, while still on earth, let Brabant's Lady see to it, that 'mong the worse flock she be not for this.",
    "When I was free from each and all those shades, who only prayed that others pray for them, that their becoming holy might be sped, \"It seems that thou deniest,\" I began, \"O thou my Light, expressly in a text, that prayer can cause a change in Heaven's decrees; and yet these people only pray for this; could it then be, that this their hope is vain, or is thy saying not quite clear to me?\"",
    "And he to me: \"That which I wrote is clear, nor yet delusive is this people's hope, if it be looked at with a healthy mind; for Justice stoops not from her lofty height, because Love's ardor all at once fulfils what he who dwelleth here must satisfy; and there where I decided on this point, the fault was not made good again by praying, because the prayer discordant was with God.",
    "Yet in so deep a doubt decide thou not, unless She bid thee do so, who a light shall be between thine intellect and truth.",
    "I know not if thou understand; I speak of Beatrice; thou 'lt see her up above, smiling and happy, on this Mountain's top.\"",
    "And I: \"Let 's go, then, Lord, with greater haste; for now I grow not weary as before; and see, the hillside casts its shadow now.\"",
    "\"We shall go forward with this day,\" he answered, \"as long as we are able; but the case is otherwise than what thou deemest it.",
    "Ere thou shalt be up there, thou him shalt see return, who now so shields him with the hill, that thou dost not compel his rays to break.",
    "But yonder see a soul who all alone is seated, and toward us is looking now; he will point out to us the quickest way.\"",
    "We came to him.",
    "O Lombard soul, how full of self-respect and noble scorn thou wast, and in the moving of thine eyes how slow and dignified! Naught did he say to us; but let us go our way, and only gazed as would a couching lion in repose.",
    "Virgil, meanwhile, drew near to him, and begged that he would show to us the best ascent; and he to his request made no reply, but asked us of our country and condition; and my kind Leader was with \"Mantua ...\"",
    "beginning, when the self-collected shade, from where he was, sprang up to meet him, saying: \"O Mantuan, I 'm Sordello, of thy town!\" and each the other thereupon embraced.",
    "Ah, Italy, thou slave, thou inn of woe, ship without pilot in a mighty storm, not queen of provinces, but house of shame! So instant ready was that noble soul, but at the sweet sound of his city's name, to welcome here his fellow citizen; and yet within thee now, thy living sons are not exempt from war, and those one wall and moat enclose upon each other prey! All round thy coast-line search its shores, poor wretch, and then within thy bosom look, and learn if any part of thee be blest with peace.",
    "What boots it that Justinian rearranged thy bridle, if thy saddle vacant be? Had it not been for that, thy shame were less.",
    "And ye, ah, ye, that ought to be devout, and so let Caesar in his saddle sit, if well ye heeded God's advice to you, behold how wild this animal has grown, through being uncorrected by the spur, since ye first set your hands upon her rein!",
    "O German Albert, thou that dost forsake this creature now become untamed and wild, and oughtest to bestride her saddle-bows, may some just judgment from the stars befall thy blood, and may it so unheard of be, and plain, that it may frighten thy successor!",
    "For, held by greed of lands outside its bounds, thou and thy father also have allowed the Empire's Garden to become a waste.",
    "Come see the Montagues and Capulets, Monaldi and Filipeschi, careless man, already troubled those, and these in dread! Come, come, thou cruel man, and see the oppression of thy nobility, and right their wrongs; and thou shalt see how safe is Santafior! Come see thy Rome, that, widowed and alone, is shedding tears, and day and night is calling: \"Why dost thou not, my Caesar, stay with me?\" Come see the people, how they love each other! And if for us no pity move thy soul, come, then, and shame thee for thine own renown! And, if I be allowed, O Jove Supreme, Thou that for us wast crucified on earth, are Thy just eyes, too, turned away elsewhere? Or in Thy counsel's depths art Thou in this a preparation making for some good, from our perception utterly cut off? For all Italia's towns are full of tyrants, and a Marcellus every churl is deemed, who comes to play a party henchman's rôle.",
    "My Florence, well mayst thou be satisfied with this digression, which concerns thee not, thanks to thy people, who look out for that!",
    "Many at heart are just, but slow to shoot, lest to the bow uncounselled they should come; but thy folk on their lips alone are just! Many refuse to bear the common burden; but thy folk eagerly respond, and cry, although uncalled: \"I 'll load myself therewith!\" Be joyful, then, since thou hast cause to be; thou that art rich, that peaceful art, and wise! Whether I speak the truth, results conceal not.",
    "Athens and Lacedaemon, they that framed the ancient laws, and were so civilized, in living well made but a little mark compared with thee, that dost so carefully provide thee, that thy fine October spinning as far as mid-November reaches not.",
    "How many times, within thy memory, hast thou changed laws and coinage, offices and customs, and thy membership renewed! And if thou well recall and face the light, thou 'lt see thy likeness to a suffering woman, who on a feather-bed can find no rest, but seeks, by tossing, to relieve her pain.",
    "After their words of greeting, dignified and glad, had three and four times been repeated, Sordello, drawing back, said: \"Who are ye?\"",
    "\"Or ever yet the spirits, who deserved to rise to God, were toward this Mount directed, my bones were buried by Octavian's order.",
    "Virgil am I; and through no other guilt did I lose Heaven, than through not having faith.\" 'T was thus my Leader thereupon replied.",
    "Like one who sudden sees before him aught he wonders at, and, as he says: \"It is ...\" and \"No, it 's not,\" believes and disbelieves; such did the former seem; and then his head he bowed, and, humbly turning back to him, embraced him where inferior men take hold.",
    "\"O glory of the Latins,\" said he then, \"through whom our language showed what it could do, eternal honor of my native town, what merit, or what grace shows thee to me? Tell me, if I deserve to hear thy words, if thou from Hell art come, and from what cloister.\"",
    "\"Through all the circles of the woeful Realm\" he answered him, \"have I come hither; virtue from Heaven impelled me, and therewith I come.",
    "'T was not for doing aught, but for not doing, I lost the sight of that exalted Sun thou longest for, and which was known by me too late.",
    "There is a place below, not sad because of pain, but only gloom, where moans sound not as wailings, but are merely sighs.",
    "There with those little innocents I dwell, who, not delivered yet from human guilt, were bitten by the teeth of death; and there with those I dwell, who did not clothe themselves with the three holy virtues, but who knew the others without vice, and practiced all.",
    "But give us, if thou know and can, some sign, whereby the sooner we may reach the place, where Purgatory hath its real beginning.\"",
    "\"No fixed place is assigned us;\" he replied, \"I may go upward and around; I 'll join thee, and be thy guide as far as I can go.",
    "But see already how the day declines, and one at night can not ascend; it, hence, were well to think of some fair resting place.",
    "Here to the right are souls that dwell apart; if thou permit me, I will lead thee to them, and not without delight will they be known.\"",
    "\"How, then, is this?\" was answered, \"Should one wish to mount by night, would some one hinder him? Or would one not ascend, through lack of power?",
    "Then with his finger good Sordello marked the ground, and: \"See!\" he said, \"When once the sun is gone, thou couldst not even cross this line; though not because aught else than gloom of night would hinder one from climbing; that it is puzzles the will with impotence.",
    "One could, however, downward go again therewith, and walking o'er the hillside, wander round while still the horizon kept the day confined.\"",
    "My Lord then said, as if in wonder lost: \"Do thou, then, lead us thither, where thou saidst that one while waiting can enjoy himself.\"",
    "But little had we gone away from there, when I perceived the hill was hollowed out, as here on earth our hillside valleys are.",
    "\"Thither,\" that shade said, \"we 'll betake ourselves where of itself the hillside forms a lap; and there will we await the coming day.\"",
    "A winding path there was, nor steep nor level, which led us to a border of the dell, where more than half away the hillside falls.",
    "Gold and fine silver, scarlet and white lead, indigo blue, wood's clear and shining brown, and green of emeralds when newly flaked,",
    "would each in hue be vanquished by the grass and flowers found growing in that bosomed dell, as by the greater vanquished is the less.",
    "Nature not only had been painting there; but with the fragrance of a thousand scents was making up a blend unknown on earth.",
    "Here, seated on the grass among the flowers, \"Salve, Regina\" singing, souls I saw, who, for the dell, could not be seen outside.",
    "\"Before the waning sunlight nest itself,\" began the Mantuan who had guided us, \"desire me not to lead you among these.",
    "Much better from this border shall ye learn to know the acts and faces of them all, than greeted 'mong them in the dale below.",
    "The one that sitteth highest up, and seems to have neglected what he should have done, and with his mouth joins not the others' songs, was Emperor Rudolph, he who might have healed the wounds that so have left Italia dead, that by another she reviveth late.",
    "He who appears to cheer him, ruled the land, where rise the waters which the Moldau gives the Elbe, and the Elbe gives the sea.",
    "Named Ottocar, he was, in swaddling clothes, far better than is Wenceslaus, his son, on whom, a bearded man, feed lust and ease.",
    "That small-nosed man, who close in counsel seems with him that hath so kind a countenance, died fleeing, and disflowering the Lily.",
    "Look at him, yonder, how he smites his breast! And see the other one, who for his cheek hath, sighing, made a cushion of his hand.",
    "Father and father-in-law of France's bane, they know the latter's foul and vicious life; hence comes the sorrow that so pierces them.",
    "The one who so large-limbed appears, and joins in song with him who hath the manly nose, was girded with the cord of every worth; and if the youth, who seated is behind him, had, following after him, remained as king, worth would, indeed, have gone from vase to vase; which of the other heirs can not be said.",
    "The kingdoms James and Frederick hold; but none is owner of the better heritage.",
    "Seldom doth human righteousness ascend among the branches; this is willed by Him who gives it, that of Him it may be asked.",
    "My words concern the large-nosed man no less than the other, Peter, who is singing with him, whence both Apulia and Provence are grieved.",
    "That plant is as inferior to its seed, as of her husband Constance still vaunts more than Beatrice and Margaret do of theirs.",
    "Behold the king, known for his simple life, Henry of England, seated there alone; he in his branches better issue hath.",
    "He that among them lower on the ground is sitting, and looks up, is Marquis William, for whom both Alexandria and her war make Montferràt and Canavèsë weep.\"",
    "'T was now the hour, which homeward turns the longing, and melts the heart of those that sail the sea, the day they 've said goodbye to tender friends; and thrills with love the pilgrim newly sped, if from afar he hear a tolling bell, that seems to mourn the slowly dying day; when I began to render hearing vain, and of those souls watch one who, risen up, was asking for attention with his hand.",
    "He joined his palms, and raising them on high, turned toward the East his eyes with steadfast gaze, as if to God he said: \"I heed naught else.\"",
    "\"Ere daylight fadeth\" issued from his mouth with such devoutness, and with notes so sweet, that I was made unmindful of myself.",
    "Thereat the others, sweetly and devoutly followed that soul, and sang the whole hymn through, fixing their gaze upon the spheres above.",
    "Sharpen thine eyes here, Reader, for the truth; for now its veil is certainly so thin, that easy is the passage into it.",
    "I saw that army of the gentle-born gazing on high in silence after this, as if in expectation, pale and meek; and, issuing from above, and coming down, two Angels with two fiery swords I saw, which, broken off, were of their points deprived.",
    "As green they were, as little new-born leaves, and clothed with garments which, behind them trailed, were stroked and fanned by verdant plumes.",
    "One came and poised somewhat above us, while the other alighted on the hillside opposite, so that the people there remained between.",
    "I well perceived that golden was their hair; but on their faces vision went astray, as would a power confounded by excess.",
    "\"From Mary's bosom both of them are come\" Sordello said, \"to guard this sheltered vale against the Serpent, which will soon arrive.\"",
    "Hence I, who knew not by what path, turned round, chilled through with fear, and to the trusted shoulders drew closely back.",
    "Sordello thereupon began: \"And now among the mighty shades let us descend, and we will speak with them; greatly will they be pleased to see you here.\"",
    "Only three steps, I think, did I go down, and was below; then one I saw, who looked at me alone, as if he wished to know me.",
    "The air had for some time been growing dark but not so much as, 'tween his eyes and mine, not to reveal what it concealed before.",
    "Toward me he came, and I toward him advanced.",
    "Noble Judge Nino, when I saw that not among the damned thou wast, how glad I was! No greetings fair were left unsaid between us; and then he asked: \"How long ago didst thou o'er the far waters reach the Mountain's foot?\"",
    "\"Oh!\" I exclaimed, \"across the fields of woe I came this morn, and in the first life am, though by thus going, I'll the other win.\"",
    "When once my answer had been heard, Sordello and he drew back, like people suddenly perplexed.",
    "The first to Virgil turned, the other, to one who there was seated, crying out: \"Get up, Corrado! Come and see what God hath as a favor willed.\"",
    "Then, turned toward me: \"By that rare gratitude thou owest Him, who hides His primal Why in such a way, that there 's no fording it; when thou art past the wide waves, ask my Joan to pray for me where to the innocent replies are given.",
    "I think her mother loves me now no more, for those white wimples hath she laid aside, which she, poor soul, must needs want back again.",
    "Through her one understands with greatest ease how long the fire of love in woman lasts, unless rekindled oft by sight and touch.",
    "The Viper which conducts the Milanese afield, will never make as beautiful a tomb for her, as would Gallura's Cock.\"",
    "These were the words he used, his countenance marked with the impress of that righteous zeal, which burneth in the heart with temperate flame.",
    "My greedy eyes now sought the sky alone, and only there, where slowest are the stars, as, nearest to its axle, is a wheel.",
    "My Leader then: \"What art thou looking at up there, my son?\" And I: \"At those three torches, wherewith the pole on this side wholly burns.\"",
    "Then he: \"The four bright stars which thou this morn didst see, are low down on the other side; and these have risen there, where those were then.\"",
    "While he was speaking thus, Sordello drew him aside, and saying: \"Yonder see our foe!\" lifted his finger up, to have him look.",
    "On that side where the little hollowed vale hath no defense, a Snake there was like that, perhaps, which gave the bitter fruit to Eve.",
    "On through the grass and flowers the wicked reptile glided, and, turning back its head at times, was licking like a beast that smoothes itself.",
    "I did not see, and therefore cannot tell, how the celestial Falcons 'gan to move, but both I clearly saw, when once in motion.",
    "When cleft by their green wings it heard the air, the Serpent fled, and back the Angels turning, regained their posts above with equal flight.",
    "The shade who, when he called him, to the Judge had closely drawn, throughout the whole assault had not one moment loosed his gaze from me.",
    "\"So may the lantern leading thee above, find in thy will the wax that is required for one to reach the enamelled green on high;\" he thus began, \"if thou of Valdimagra, or of its neighboring land, dost know true news, tell it to me, who once was mighty there.",
    "Corrado Malaspina I was called; I 'm not the elder, but from him descended; I bore my race the love which here is cleansed.\"",
    "\"Oh!\" said I then to him, \"I 've never been in your domains, but where throughout all Europe dwelleth a man who knows them not? The fame which honoreth your house, proclaims its lords, proclaims its district, so that even he knows of them, who hath never been there yet.",
    "I swear to you, so may I go on high, that of the glorious use of purse and sword your honored race doth not despoil itself.",
    "Nature and use so favor it, that, howe'er the guilty Head distort the world, alone it goeth straight, and scorns the evil path.\"",
    "And he: \"Now go, for lo, the sun shall not seven times on that bed rest him, which the Ram now covers, and with all four feet bestrides, ere this thy courteously expressed opinion shall in the middle of thy head be nailed with greater nails than words of other men, unless the course of doom decreed be stayed.\"",
    "Already was old Titan's concubine whitening upon the Orient's balcony, outside the arms of her sweet paramour; already was her forehead shining bright with gems, arranged according to the shape of that cold beast, which smites one with its tail; and Night had of the steps wherewith she climbs, already taken two where we were then, and now the third was lowering its wings; when I, who had somewhat of Adam in me, o'ercome with sleep, reclined upon the grass, on which all five of us were sitting then.",
    "Near morning, at the hour in which the swallow begins to sing her melancholy lays, perchance in memory of her earliest woes, and when, much more a pilgrim from the flesh, and less imprisoned by its thoughts, our mind well nigh prophetic in its vision is; an Eagle in a dream I seemed to see suspended in the sky, with plumes of gold and wings outspread, intent on swooping down;",
    "and it appeared to me that I was where his friends were left behind by Ganymede, when to the highest council he was raised.",
    "I thought within myself: \"Perhaps this bird is wont to strike but here, and from elsewhere, perhaps, disdains to lift one with its claws.\" Then, having wheeled a while, it seemed to me that terrible as lightning it came down, and bore me up as far as to the fire.",
    "There it and I both seemed to burn together; and so intense was that imagined burning, my sleep was broken of necessity.",
    "Achilles roused himself no differently — turning around him his awakened eyes, nor knowing in what region he might be, when, sleeping in her arms, his mother took him away from Chiron to the isle of Scyros, from which the Greeks removed him afterwards — than I aroused myself, when from my face sleep fled away; and death-like pale I turned, like one who freezes when o'ercome by fright.",
    "Only my Comforter was at my side, and now the sun was higher than two hours, and toward the open sea my face was turned.",
    "\"Be not afraid!\" my Lord then said to me.",
    "\"Be reassured, for we are faring well; restrain not, but expand thine every power!",
    "At Purgatory art thou now arrived; behold the cliff there, which encloses it; behold the entrance where it broken seems.",
    "Just now, when, in the dawn preceding day, thy soul was sleeping in thee on the flowers, wherewith the place down yonder is adorned, a Lady came and said: ‘I am Lucaa; allow me to take up this sleeping man; I shall assist him thus upon his way.' Sordello and the other noble forms remained; she took thee, and when daylight dawned, hither came up, and in her foot-prints I.",
    "She laid thee here; and first her lovely eyes revealed to me that opened entrance; then both she and sleep together passed away.\"",
    "Like one who, when in doubt, is reassured, and into comfort turns his fear, when once the truth has been disclosed to him, I changed; and when my Leader wholly freed from care beheld me, upward o'er the cliff he moved, and I behind him followed toward the height.",
    "Reader, thou surely see'st how I exalt my subject; therefore be thou not surprised if I support it now with greater art.",
    "Nearer we drew, and were in such a place, that where at first there seemed to be a break, just like a fissure that divides a wall,",
    "I saw a Gate, and under, to approach it, three steps of different color each, and then a Keeper, who as yet said not a word.",
    "And as I opened more and more mine eyes, I saw him sitting on the upper step, such in his face that I endured him not; and in his hand he had a naked sword, which so reflected upon us its rays, that toward him oft I turned my eyes in vain.",
    "\"Say what it is you wish, from where you are,\" he then began, \"and where your escort is.",
    "Beware lest coming up should do you harm.\"",
    "\"A heavenly Lady, of these things aware,\" my Teacher answered him, \"said unto us just now: ‘Go thither, yonder is the Gate.'\"",
    "\"And unto good may she advance your steps!\" the courteous Keeper of the Gate resumed, \"Come forward, therefore, unto these our stairs.\"",
    "Made of white marble was the first great step to which we came, so polished and so smooth, I mirrored me therein as I appear.",
    "The second step, darker than purple-black, was of a rough and calcined kind of stone, cracked lengthwise and across.",
    "The third, which rests in massive shape above it, seemed to me to be of porphyry as flaming red, as blood appears when spurting from a vein.",
    "Upon this last God's Angel held both feet, sitting upon the threshold, which to me appeared to be a rock of adamant.",
    "Up over those three steps my Leader then drew me along with my good will, and said: \"Humbly request him to undo the lock.\" Devoutly at his holy feet I cast me; I begged that of his mercy he would open, but first I smote upon my breast three times.",
    "Then with his sword's sharp point he traced seven P's upon my brow, and told me: \"See thou to it, that, when inside, thou wash away these wounds!\"",
    "Ashes, or earth when excavated dry, would with his garment of one color be; and from beneath it he drew forth two Keys.",
    "One was of gold, the other silver was; first with the white, and after with the yellow, he so did to the Gate that I was pleased.",
    "\"Whenever one of these Keys faileth so, that in the lock it doth not rightly turn,\" said he to us, \"this passage opens not.",
    "More precious is the first; and yet the other, ere it unlock, much skill and judgment needs, for it is that one which unties the knot.",
    "Peter, from whom I hold them, bade me err rather in opening, than in keeping closed, provided folk fell prostrate at my feet.\"",
    "He pushed the holy Portal's door thereat, and said to us: \"Go in; but I inform you that he who looks behind returns outside.\" And when that sacred Gateway's folding doors, which were of strong resounding metal made, were on their iron hinges turned around, Tarpeia roared not so, nor proved so shrill, when good Metellus was removed from her, because of which she afterwards kept lean.",
    "I turned to heed its first resounding tones, and \"Thee we praise, O Lord\" I seemed to hear in voices mixed with those delightful sounds.",
    "What I was hearing made upon me then just the impression one is wont to get, when people with an organ sing; for now the words are heard, and now again are not.",
    "When past the threshold of the Gate we were, whose use the evil love of souls impairs, because it makes the crooked path seem straight, 't was by its sound I knew that it had closed; and, had I turned mine eyes in its direction, what would have fittingly excused my fault?",
    "We mounted through a fissure in the rock, which moved about to this side and to that, as moves a wave that flees and draweth near.",
    "\"A little skill must here be used by us,\" my Leader then began, \"in keeping close, now here, now there, to the receding side.\"",
    "This caused our steps to be so slow and short, that to her bed the waning moon had gone to rest herself again, ere we had issued forth from that needle's eye; but when set free we were, and in the open up above, where back the Mountain's side recedes, I, weary, and both of us uncertain of our way, stopped short upon a level place up there, more lonely than are roads through desert lands.",
    "From where its margin borders on the void, up to the foot of that high rising bank, would measure thrice a human body's length; and far as e'er mine eye could wing its flight, now on the right, and now upon the left, such did this girding ledge appear to me.",
    "Our feet had not been moving on it yet, when I perceived the bank surrounding it — which, being perpendicular, could not be climbed — white marble was, and so adorned with carvings, that not only Polyclètus, but Nature, too, would there be put to shame.",
    "The Angel who to earth came with the word of peace, which, wept-for during many years, had after its long closure opened Heaven, appeared before us there in gentle mien, sculptured so truthfully, it did not seem that he could be an image that is dumb.",
    "One would have sworn that he was saying: \"Hail!\" for She was there portrayed in effigy, who turned the key that opened Love on high; and in her mien and acts she had the words \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord\" impressed as clearly as a figure stamped in wax.",
    "\"Keep not thy mind on one place only fixed!\" my gentle Teacher said, who had me there on that side of him, where one has his heart;",
    "I therefore moved my eyes, and further on than Mary, on the side where him I had, who urged me to go on, I then beheld another story graven in the rock; passing by Virgil, therefore, I drew near so that it might be set before mine eyes.",
    "Cut in the marble there the cart and oxen were drawing up the holy Ark, which made men dread a charge not given them in trust.",
    "People in front appeared; and all of them, forming seven choirs, made one of my two senses say \"No,\" and the other one say \"Yes, they sing.\" So, too, by reason of the incense-smoke, which there was pictured forth, my eyes and nose became discordant as to Yes and No.",
    "The humble Psalmist there, with loins girt up, came dancing on, before the blessèd Vessel, and, doing so, was more and less than king.",
    "And Michal, opposite to this portrayed, was from a palace window looking down, as would an angry woman filled with scorn.",
    "From where I was, I onward moved my feet, that I might closely note another tale, which after Michal gleamed upon me white.",
    "The glorious action of that Roman prince was storied here, whose worth moved Gregory to win his mighty triumph; I refer",
    "to Emperor Trajan; at his bridle stood a widow who, in tears, showed signs of grief.",
    "The space around him there seemed trampled down and thronged with horsemen, while above his head eagles, it seemed, upon a field of gold were fluttering in the wind.",
    "Among all these the sorrowing woman seemed to say: \"My lord, avenge me for the slaying of my son, which breaks my heart.\" And he to answer her: \"Wait now till I return.\" And she, like one whom sorrow makes impatient, said: \"But what, my lord, if thou shouldst not return?\" And he: \"That one will do it, who shall hold my place.\" \"How shall another's goodness help thy case,\" she answered him, \"if thou forget thine own?\" Then he: \"Now be thou comforted; for needs must I perform my duty ere I leave; justice so wills, and pity keeps me here.\"",
    "He to whose vision naught was ever new, created this seen language, new to us, since not found here on earth.",
    "While with delight I looked upon the pictures of such great humilities, which for their Maker's sake are also dear to see, \"On this side, lo, much people come, but slow the steps they take;\" the Poet murmured, \"toward the grades above these souls will send us forward on our way.\"",
    "Mine eyes, intent on gazing, to behold new things, for which with eagerness they long, in turning toward him were not slow to move.",
    "Yet I 'd not have thee, Reader, shrink dismayed from thy good purposes, through hearing how God wills that what is due be paid.",
    "Heed not the nature of the torment! Think of what comes after! Think that, at the very worst, beyond the Judgment-day it cannot go.",
    "Then I began: \"That, Teacher, which toward us I see advancing does not look like people, nor know I what, my sight is so deceived.\"",
    "And he to me: \"Their torment's heavy nature so bows them toward the ground, that my eyes, too, struggled therewith at first.",
    "But steadily gaze there, and disentangle with thine eyes what underneath those stones is coming on; thou now canst see how each one smites himself.\"",
    "O ye proud Christians, sad and weary creatures, who, sick in mental vision, put your trust in backward moving steps; perceive ye not that worms we are, created but to form the angelic butterfly, which flies unscreened to judgment? Why, then, is it that your mind soars up in pride, since ye are, as it were, defective insects, even as is a worm, in which formation is not yet complete?",
    "As, to hold up a ceiling or a roof, in lieu of corbel, one perceives at times a human figure joining knees to breast, which out of unreality gives birth to real distress in him who sees it; such seemed these to me, when I had given good heed.",
    "They were, in truth, both more and less bowed down, as each had more or less upon his back; but he that in his acts most patient was, seemed to say, weeping: \"I can bear no more!\"",
    "\"Our Father, Thou that in the Heavens dost dwell, not circumscribed, but for the greater love Thou hast for what Thou madest first on high; let both Thy Name and Worth be given praise by every creature, ev'n as it is meet that to Thy loving Spirit thanks be given! And may Thy Kingdom's Peace come down to us, since we can not attain it of ourselves, for all our striving, save it also come! As gladly of their wills Thine Angels make a sacrifice to Thee, singing ‘All Hail!', so likewise gladly may men do with theirs! Give us this day our daily spirit-food, without which, through this bitter wilderness, he backward goes, who onward toileth most! And as we pardon every one the wrong we 've suffered, of Thy Mercy do Thou us forgive, regarding not what we deserve! Our virtue which is easily o'ercome, test Thou not through our ancient Enemy, but set us free from him, who tempts it so!",
    "This last request, dear Lord, is not, indeed, made for ourselves, who need not make it here, but is for their sake who behind us stayed.\"",
    "Thus praying good speed for themselves and us, those shades beneath a burden went their way, not unlike that whereof one dreams at times, unequally tormented, all of them, and weary, o'er the first ring, round and round, purging away the world's defiling mists.",
    "If good things there be always said for us, what can be said and done on their behalf down here, by those whose will is rooted well? Surely one ought to help them wash away the stains they brought with them, that they may issue, cleansed and unburdened, to the starry spheres.",
    "\"Pray, so may pity and Justice speedily unburden you, that ye may move your wings, and raise yourselves according to your wish, show us on which hand lies the shortest way to reach the stairs; and, be there more than one, teach us the pass that hath the gentlest slope; for, owing to the load of Adam's flesh, which clothes his spirit, he who with me comes is slow in climbing, though against his will.\"",
    "As to the words, which in reply they said to those which he, whom I was following, spoke, it was not evident from whom they came;",
    "but this was said: \"Come with us on the right along the bank, and ye shall find the pass, which may be climbed by one that's still alive.",
    "And were I not prevented by the stone, which tames my haughty neck, and forces me to keep my face bowed down, at this man here, who liveth still and telleth not his name, I 'd look, to see if he is one I know, and stir his pity for this heavy load.",
    "Latin I was, and born to a great Tuscan; Guglielmo Aldobrandesco was my father; I know not if you ever knew his name.",
    "My forebears' ancient blood and noble deeds caused me to be so arrogant, that I, unmindful of our common mother, earth, held every man in scorn to such extent, I died for it, as well knows Siena's folk, and every child in Campagnàtico.",
    "I am Omberto; nor to me alone doth this work ill, for pride hath with itself drawn all my kin into calamity.",
    "And here, for this, must I needs bear this load among the dead, till God be satisfied, since I among the living bore it not.\"",
    "Listening, I bowed my face; and one of them, not he who had been speaking, writhed around under the burden which was hampering him;",
    "and, having seen and recognized me, called, and kept his eyes with effort fixed on me, who, as I went along with them, was stooping.",
    "Then \"Oh!\" said I, \"Art thou not Oderisi, the glory of Agobbio and the art, which is in Paris called ‘illuminating'?\"",
    "\"Brother,\" said he, \"more smiling are the parchments which Franco Bolognese paints; the glory is now all his and only partly mine.",
    "Because of that great longing to excel, whereon my heart was set, I certainly would not have been so courteous while I lived.",
    "Here is the forfeit paid for pride like this; nor should I be here yet, had it not been that, while I still could sin, I turned to God.",
    "O empty glory of our human powers, how short a time green lasts upon its top, unless uncultured ages overtake it! Once Cimabùe thought that he would hold the field in painting, yet the cry is all for Giotto now, hence that one's fame is dark.",
    "Thus hath one Guido taken from the other the glory of our tongue; and he is born, perhaps, who from the nest will banish both.",
    "Worldly repute is but a breath of wind, which cometh now from here, and now from there, and shifts its name, because its quarter shifts.",
    "What greater fame shalt thou have — if when old thou quit thy flesh, than hadst thou died ere ‘pap' and ‘chink' were dropped, — a thousand years from now? For that, if to eternity compared, is shorter than the twinkling of an eye is to the sky's most slowly moving sphere.",
    "All Tuscany proclaimed the fame of him, who walks so slowly on the road before me; yet hardly is a whisper of him left in Siena now, whose governor he was, what time the rage of Florence was destroyed, which then as haughty was, as abject now.",
    "Your worldly fame is like the hue of grass, which comes and goes, and he discolors it, through whom it springs up tender from the ground.\"",
    "And I: \"Thy true speech heart'ning me with good humility, thou prickst my swollen pride; but who is he of whom thou spok'st just now?",
    "\"That\" he replied, \"is Provenzàn Salvani; and here he is, because presumptuously he brought all Siena under his control.",
    "Thus hath he gone, and without rest he goes, e'er since he died; who yonder dares too much, in satisfaction pays such coin as this.\"",
    "And I then: \"If the spirit who delays, before repenting, till the verge of life, abides below, and cometh not up here,",
    "unless good prayers assist him, till as long a time be passed as he had been alive, wherefore hath this man's coming been vouchsafed?\"",
    "\"When in his greatest glory,\" he replied, \"all shame removed, he freely took his stand in Siena's Campo; and there, to free a friend suffering in Charles' prison, he brought himself to quake in every vein.",
    "I 'll say no more, and know that what I say is darkly spoken; but so, ere long, will thine own neighbors act, that thou 'lt be able to interpret it.",
    "This deed of his relieved him from those bounds.\"",
    "With equal steps, like oxen going yoked, I went along beside that burdened soul, as long as my dear Pedagogue allowed; but when he said: \"Leave him, and go thou on; for here 't is well that each should urge his bark with sail and oars, as much as e'er he can,\" I straightened me as much as walking called for, although my thoughts kept humble and depressed.",
    "On had I moved, and in my Teacher's steps was following willingly, and both of us were showing now how light of step we were, when \"Downward turn thine eyes!\" he said to me, \"Well will it be, to calm thee on thy way, that thou shouldst see the bed thy soles are treading.\"",
    "As over those that 'neath them buried lie — that they may be recalled to people's minds — tombs level with the ground the record bear of what they were before; whence there they oft are wept for, through the prick of memory, which spurs to grief the pitiful alone;",
    "ev'n so I saw engraved in sculpture here, though finer in respect to workmanship, as much as from the Mount juts out as path.",
    "I saw, on one side, Him who once was made nobler by far than any other creature, fall like a flash of lightning down from Heaven.",
    "I saw Briareus, on the other side, pierced by an arrow from the sky, lie prone, and heavy on the ground with mortal cold.",
    "I saw Apollo, Mars I saw and Pallas, as, still in armor, round their Sire they stood, gazing upon the Giants' scattered limbs.",
    "I saw great Nimrod 'neath his mighty work dumb with confusion, as he watched the folk, who once were proud with him on Shinar's plain.",
    "O Niobe, with what sad eyes I thee saw pictured forth in stone, between thy children, the seven and seven thy dead, upon the road!",
    "O Saul, how plainly there on thine own sword didst thou seem dead upon Gilbòa's mount, which felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!",
    "O mad Arachne, thee I saw, as when, already half a spider, thou wast sad amid the tatters of thy fatal work.",
    "O Rehoboam, not a threat seems now thy face, but terror-stricken, as away a chariot bears thee, lest thou be pursued.",
    "It showed, moreover, that hard pavement did, how costly once Alcmaeon caused his mother's unlucky ornament to seem to her.",
    "It showed how, in the temple's walls, his sons cast themselves on Sennacherib, and how, when he was dead, they there abandoned him.",
    "It showed the slaughter and the cruel woe wrought by Tomyris, when she said to Cyrus: \"With blood I fill thee, that didst thirst for blood!\"",
    "It showed, too, how the Assyrians took to flight, routed, when Holophernes had been killed, and also what was of that slaughter left.",
    "I saw proud Troy in ashes and in caves.",
    "O Ilion, how degraded and how vile it showed thou wast, the image there perceived!",
    "What master, or of brush or graving-tool, could reproduce the shadows and the features, which there would cause all cultured minds to wonder? The dead seemed dead, the living seemed alive; whoever saw the real, no better saw than I then did what I was treading on, as long as bowed I walked.",
    "Be ye, then, proud, and go with haughty looks, ye sons of Eve, nor bow your heads, to see your evil path!",
    "More of the Mountain had we circled now, and of the sun's course far more had we spent, than my not disengaged mind had supposed;",
    "when he who always walked attentively ahead of me, began: \"Lift up thy head! The time for going thus absorbed is passed.",
    "See there an Angel who is making ready to come toward us; see how the sixth handmaiden returns now from the service of the day.",
    "With reverence adorn thine acts and face, that he may now be pleased to send us up; think that this day will never dawn again!\"",
    "So well accustomed was I to his warning, that I should never let my time be lost, that on this theme he could not darkly speak.",
    "Toward us the lovely Creature was advancing, arrayed in white, and in his countenance, such as, when trembling, seems the morning star.",
    "His arms he opened, then he oped his wings, and said to us: \"Come; near by are the steps, and going up is easy after this.\"",
    "Only a few to this announcement come.",
    "O human race, why, born for upward flight, fallest thou so before a little wind?",
    "He led us on to where the rock was cut; and there my forehead with his wings he stroked, and promised that my passage would be safe.",
    "As, on the right hand, to ascend the mount, where seated is the church, which dominates the well ruled town o'er Rubaconte's bridge,",
    "the slope's bold flight is broken by the stairs constructed in an age, when quire and stave were safe; so, likewise, doth the bank relax, which from the next ledge here quite steeply falls; but closely on each side the high rock rubs.",
    "While, turning thither, we were on our way, \"Blest are the poor in spirit!\" voices sang in such a way as words could not describe.",
    "Alas! how different are the passes here from those in Hell! For one up here goes in with songs, but there below with frightful wails!",
    "We now were climbing up the holy stairs, and lighter far I felt than formerly I seemed to be, when on the level ground; I hence said: \"Teacher, say, what heavy thing has been removed from me, that, as I walk, I almost feel no weariness at all?\"",
    "He answered: \"When the P's, which still remain almost extinct upon thy brow, are quite erased, as one is now, thy feet will so be conquered by good will, that they will feel not only no fatigue, but it will be a pleasure to them to be upward urged.\"",
    "I then did as do those, who go about with something on their head they know not of, till others' gestures cause them to suspect;",
    "whereat their hand assists in ascertaining, searches, and finds, and so performs the work, which cannot be accomplished by their sight; and with my right hand's fingers spread I found that only six the letters were, which he who held the Keys, had o'er my temples cut; on seeing which my Leader smiled with joy.",
    "We now were at the summit of the stairs, where for the second time is cut away the Mount, ascent of which frees one from sin; and there a cornice, like the first one, girds the hillside round about, save that its arc more quickly curves.",
    "There is no shaded carving apparent here, nor is there any mark; the bank seems bare, as also seems the path, with but the livid color of the rock.",
    "\"If we await folk here, of whom to ask our way,\" the Poet argued, \"I 'm afraid our choice will be, perhaps, delayed too long.\"",
    "Then on the sun he fixed his steadfast eyes, made of his right the center for his motion, and turned the left side of himself around.",
    "\"O thou sweet light, with confidence in whom I enter this new path, conduct us thou,\" he said, \"as one should be conducted here.",
    "Thou warm'st the world, and on it thou dost shine; if aught else urge not to the contrary, thy rays at all times ought to be our guides.\"",
    "Already had we gone as far up there, as here on earth is reckoned for a mile, in little time, because of ready will; when, flying toward us, there were spirits heard, who, though unseen, were to the board of love uttering their courteous calls.",
    "The voice which first passed flying, said aloud: \"They have no wine!\" and then behind us kept repeating it; and ere, because of having moved away, it could be heard no more, another, passing, cried: \"I 'm Orestes!\" nor did that one linger.",
    "\"What are these voices, Father?\" said I then; and ev'n while I was asking, lo, a third, which said: \"Love those, from whom ye've ill received!\"",
    "The kindly Teacher then: \"This circle whips the fault of envy, hence the scourge's cords are drawn from love.",
    "The curb will probably give forth a sound the contrary of this; in my opinion, I believe thou 'lt hear it, before the pass of pardon thou attain.",
    "But keenly through the air address thy gaze, and thou 'lt see people on ahead of us, who seated are, and each against the cliff.\"",
    "Then wider than before I oped mine eyes; I looked ahead, and shades I saw with cloaks not differing from the color of the stone.",
    "And when a little further on we were, I heard one crying: \"Mary, pray for us!\" and cries to Michael, Peter, and all the Saints.",
    "Nor do I think there walks on earth to-day a man so hard, that he would not be pierced by sympathy for what I then perceived; for, after I had drawn so near to them, that what they did with clearness came to me, tears from my eyes were drawn by bitter grief.",
    "Covered they seemed to me with coarse hair-cloth, and one sustained the other with his shoulder, while all of them were by the bank sustained.",
    "Ev'n thus the blind, in want of livelihood, at Pardons stand to beg for what they need, and one upon the other bows his head, that pity may be speedily aroused, not merely by the sound of what they say, but by their aspect, which no less implores.",
    "And as the sun availeth not the blind, so to the shades, whereof I spoke just now, the sky's light willeth not to grant itself; because an iron band runs through, and sews the eyelids of them all, as with wild hawks one does, since otherwise they 'd not keep still.",
    "To me it seemed an outrage that, unseen, I should see others, as I walked along; I therefore turned to my wise Counselor.",
    "He well knew what the dumb man wished to say; and therefore waited not for me to ask, but \"Speak,\" he said, \"be brief and to the point.\"",
    "Virgil on that side of the cornice-ledge was coming on with me, whence one can fall, because it wreathes itself with no bank there.",
    "On the other side I had those zealous shades, who through the horrid seams were pressing so their tears, that they were bathing both their cheeks.",
    "Turning to them, I thus began: \"O people, who certain are of seeing that High Light, which your desire hath for its only object; so melt Grace soon the scum upon your conscience, that memory's stream may through it clearly flow, tell me, for grateful will it be to me and pleasing, if there is among you here a soul that Latin is; it will be well for him, perhaps, if I should come to know it.\"",
    "\"O brother mine, we both are citizens of one true City; but thou meanest one, who, while a pilgrim, lived in Italy.\"",
    "It seemed to me that this I heard for answer a little further on than where I was; I therefore let myself be heard much further.",
    "Among the rest I saw a shade which seemed expectant in its looks; and, if one ask \"How so?\" held up its chin as do the blind.",
    "\"Spirit,\" said I, \"that dost subdue thyself, that thou mayst climb, if she that didst reply, make thyself known to me by place or name.\"",
    "\"Sienese I was;\" she answered, \"and with these cleanse here my guilty life, and pray to Him with tears, that He may lend Himself to us.",
    "Though called Sapaa, sapient was I not, for I was far more glad of others' harm, than I of my good fortune ever was.",
    "And, that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee, ev'n as I tell thee, hear how mad I was, once my years' arch was on its downward course.",
    "When with their foes my fellow citizens were joined in battle near the town of Colle, I prayed to God for that which He had willed.",
    "When, routed there, they took the bitter path of flight, I felt, on seeing them pursued, a joy unequalled by all other joys; I therefore upward turned my daring face, and cried to God: ‘I fear Thee now no more!' as doth the blackbird at the least fair weather.",
    "When I was at the end of life, I longed for peace with God; but not yet would my debt have been diminished by repentance here, had it not been that Pietro Pettinagno, who of his charity was grieved for me, was mindful of me in his holy prayers.",
    "But who art thou, that askest of our state while going on, and hast thine eyes unclosed, as I believe, and dost, while breathing, talk?\"",
    "\"Mine eyes will yet be taken from me here, but not for long;\" said I, \"for they have not offended much by being turned by envy.",
    "Far greater is the fear, wherewith my soul is filled, of that tormenting pain below, for even now the load there weighs upon me.\"",
    "And she: \"Who, then, led thee to us up here, if to return below thou think?\" And I: \"He that is with me here, and speaketh not.",
    "But I am living, therefore ask of me, elected spirit, if thou'dst have me move my mortal feet in thy behalf on earth.\"",
    "\"Oh, this\" she answered, \"is so strange to hear, that certainly it proves God's love for thee; therefore assist me with thy prayers at times! I beg thee by what most thou longest for, if e'er thou tread the soil of Tuscany, that thou among my kin restore my fame.",
    "Among that vain folk wilt thou see them there, which hopes in Talamone, and will waste more hope on it than on the Diàna quest; but still more will the admirals invest.\"",
    "\"Who is this spirit, who around our Mount is circling thus, ere death have giv'n him flight, and at his will opens and veils his eyes?\"",
    "\"I know not who he is, but know he 's not alone; ask thou, that nearer art to him, and greet him fairly, so that he may speak.\"",
    "Two spirits, who were leaning on each other, thus talked of me upon the right hand there; then turned their faces up, to speak to me; and one said: \"Soul, that, still held in thy body, toward Heaven art going, of thy charity console us now, and tell us whence thou com'st, and who thou art; for thou dost cause in us such wonder at the grace accorded thee, as that demands which never was before.\"",
    "And I: \"A small stream winds through Tuscany, which up in Falterona hath its rise, and is not sated by a hundred miles.",
    "From somewhere on its banks I bring this body; vain would it be to tell you who I am, because my name makes no great sound as yet.\"",
    "\"If with my mind I rightly penetrate thy meaning,\" that one then replied to me; who spoke before, \"thou talkest of the Arno.\"",
    "Thereat the other spirit said to him: \"Why did this man conceal that river's name, as people hide the name of dreadful things?\"",
    "The shade who had been questioned as to this, discharged its duty thus: \"I do not know; but meet it is that this vale's name should die! For from its source — where that wild mountain-chain, whence severed is Pelorus, swells so greatly, that in few places doth it pass that mark — to there where it betakes it to restore whatever from the sea the sky sucks up, whence rivers get what goes along with them, virtue is, snake-like, as a foe pursued by all, or through the region's evil luck, or through bad customs which incite men there; hence those that in this wretched valley dwell, have changed their nature so, that it would seem that Circe had them in her pasturage.",
    "Among foul hogs, of acorns worthier far than of all other food that's fit for man to use, it first directs its sorry path.",
    "As down it comes, it afterward finds curs, that snarl more fiercely than their strength comports, and turns from these its snout aside in scorn.",
    "It keeps on falling; and the more it swells, the more that cursèd and unlucky ditch finds that the dogs are turning into wolves.",
    "Descending then through many a gloomy gorge, foxes it finds, so full of fraud, that naught have they to fear, lest cunning master them.",
    "Nor shall I cease to speak, though overheard; and for this man 't were well, if he recall hereafter what a truthful spirit shows me.",
    "Thy grandson I behold, who first becomes a hunter of those wolves upon the banks of that fierce stream, and terrifies them all.",
    "He sells their flesh, while still alive; then kills them, as an old beast he would; of life depriving many, himself of honor he deprives.",
    "He issues bloody from the dismal wood, and leaves it such, that in a thousand years 't will not rewood itself as once it was.\"",
    "As at the announcement of some painful loss, the face of him who listens is disturbed, from wheresoe'er the danger may assail him; ev'n thus did I behold that other soul, who turned to listen, grow distressed and sad, as soon as he had gathered in that speech.",
    "The words of one soul and the other's face had caused me to desire to know their names; therefore with prayers I mingled this request.",
    "That spirit, therefore, who addressed me first, began again: \"Thou'dst have me condescend to do for thee what thou for me wilt not.",
    "But since God wills that so much of His Grace should shine in thee, I 'll not be niggardly; Guido del Duca know, then, that I am.",
    "And so consumed by envy was my blood, that, had I seen a man becoming happy, livid with envy thou hadst seen me turn.",
    "Of what I sowed I'm reaping now the straw.",
    "O human race, why set your heart on things, wherein companionship must be forbidden?",
    "This is Rinieri; this the honor is, and glory of the house of Calboli, whose worth, since him, none hath inherited.",
    "Nor hath his blood alone despoiled itself, 'tween Po and mountains, Reno and the sea, of those good things which truth and joy require; for in those bounds the country is so full of poisoned stocks, that only slowly now would they be lessened, ev'n if it were tilled.",
    "Where are good Lazio, Arrigo Mainàrdi, Pier Traversaro and Guido di Carpigna? O Romagnoles, turned into bastards now! When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise? When, in Faenza, a Bernardin di Fosco, the noble scion of a little plant?",
    "Wonder not, Tuscan, if I weep now, when, with Guido da Prata, I recall to mind Ugolin d'Azzo, who among us dwelt, Frederick Tignoso and his company, the Traversara house, the Anastagi, (and both these families are void of heirs), the ladies and the knights, the toils and ease, which love and courtesy once made us crave, where hearts have grown so bad! O Brettinoro, wherefore not vanish, since thy family, and many people with them, have departed, that guiltless they might be? Bàgnacavàl, begetting sons no longer, doeth well; but Castrocaro ill, and Conio worse, which still takes trouble to beget such counts.",
    "Well the Pagani, too, will fare, when once their demon shall have gone, but not so well, that an unspotted fame will e'er remain to them.",
    "O Ugolin de' Fàntoli, thy name is safe, since one can now no more be looked for, who, as a degenerate, can darken it! But go thy way now, Tuscan; for weeping now affords me far more zest than speech, our talk hath so distressed my mind!\"",
    "We knew that those dear spirits heard us leaving; and therefore merely by their keeping still, they made us trust the path which we were taking.",
    "When we, advancing, found ourselves alone, a voice, which seemed like lightning when it cleaves the air, was heard, and, as it reached us there, said: \"Whosoever findeth me shall slay me!\" then vanished, as when thunder rolls away, if suddenly a cloud be rent apart.",
    "Soon as our hearing had a truce from this, behold another with so great a crash, it seemed to be its following thunder-clap: \"I am Aglauros, who was turned to stone!\" Then, to draw closer to the Poet's side, I took a backward, not a forward, step.",
    "The air was calm on all sides now, when he: \"That was the painful bit, which in his bounds should hold a man.",
    "But ye take in the bait, and so the ancient Adversary's hook draweth you to him; hence of small avail is either curb or lure.",
    "Heaven calleth you, and, showing to you its eternal beauties, around you moves, and yet your eyes look down; hence He, who seeth all things, scourges you.\"",
    "Between the third hour's close and day's beginning as much as is apparent of the sphere, which like a child is ever given to play, so much now of its course toward evening seemed remaining to the sun; 't was vespers there, and midnight here; and fully on the face its rays were striking us, because the Mount had so been circled by us, that we now were going on directly toward the West; when, far more blindingly than e'er before, I felt my forehead overcome by splendor, and was bewildered by these unknown things; over my eyebrows, hence, I raised my hands, and made myself the screen which, filing off, tempers excessive light in what is seen.",
    "As when from water, or a looking-glass, a ray leaps up in the opposite direction, and in the same way mounts that down it came, and from the falling of a stone departs at equal distance to the same extent, as both experiment and art reveal;",
    "even so it seemed to me that I was smitten as by a light, reflected there before me; because of which my sight was swift to flee.",
    "\"Dear Father, what is that,\" said I, \"from which I cannot screen my face sufficiently to help me, and which toward us seems to come?\"",
    "\"Wonder thou not\" he answered me, \"if still Heaven's family affect thy sight; an Angel is this, who comes to ask us to ascend.",
    "It soon will happen that to see such things will be no burden, but as great a joy, as Nature hath enabled thee to feel.\"",
    "As soon as we had reached the blessèd Angel, with joyful voice he said: \"Enter from hence a stairway far less steep than were the rest!\"",
    "We were ascending, having thence departed, when \"Blessèd are the Merciful!\" was sung behind us, and \"Rejoice, O thou that winnest!\"",
    "My Teacher then, and I, we two alone, were going up; and, as we went, I thought of how I might get profit from his words; whereat I turned toward him, and asked: \"What meant that spirit from Romagna, when he mentioned ‘forbidden,' and ‘companionship' in things?\"",
    "Hence he: \"Of his worst fault he knows the harm; hence let it not surprise, if he therefor rebuke men, that it be lamented less.",
    "Because your wishes aim at that, wherein each share is lessened through companionship, envy fain moves the bellows for your sighs.",
    "If love, though, for the highest sphere of all were upward turning your desires, that fear would not be in your breast; because the more there are up yonder by whom Ours' is said, so much more good doth each of them possess, and so much more love in that cloister burns.\"",
    "\"I fast much more from being satisfied,\" said I, \"than had I silent been at first; and more of doubt I gather in my mind.",
    "How can it be, then, that a good that's shared should make more owners richer with itself, than if by but a few it be possessed?\"",
    "And he to me: \"Because thou fastenest thy mind exclusively on earthly things, thou drawest darkness out of very light.",
    "That Good, Ineffable and Infinite, which dwells up yonder, runs as fast to love, as to bright bodies comes a ray of light.",
    "So much It gives Itself, as is the warmth It findeth; hence, as is the extent of love, so much the Eternal Worth spreads over it.",
    "The more there are up there that love each other, the more there are to love, and more the love, and, mirror-like, the more of love each sheds on each.",
    "And if my talk sate not thy hunger, thou shalt see Beatrice, and she will fully free thee from this and every other want.",
    "Do thou, then, see to it that speedily thou have removed, as two already are, the five wounds which are closed by causing pain.\"",
    "Wishing to say: \"Thou satisfiest me,\" I saw that I had reached the following ring; my fond eyes, therefore, caused me to keep still.",
    "There it appeared to me that I was wrapt in an ecstatic vision all at once, and that within a temple I perceived much people; and a Lady at the door, who with the sweet mien of a mother said: \"Wherefore, my Son, hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought for thee in sorrow!\" Here, when she had ceased to speak, that disappeared which had before appeared.",
    "Then there appeared another, o'er whose cheeks those tears were streaming down, which grief distills, when born of great resentment toward another, saying: \"If thou art master of the city, about whose name there was among the gods such strife, and whence all knowledge sparkles forth, avenge thyself on those audacious arms, Pisastratus, which dared embrace our daughter!\" Kindly and gently then that lord appeared",
    "to answer her with looks of self-control: \"What shall we do to him who hateth us, if he who loves us is by us condemned?\"",
    "Then folk I saw inflamed by anger's fire who, bent on killing a young man with stones, cried to each other naught but: \"Kill him, kill!\" And him I saw, bowed to the ground in death which now oppressed him; of his eyes he e'er made gates of Heaven, and in that anguish prayed the Lord on high with looks which unlock pity, that He his persecutors would forgive.",
    "When once my mind returned outside again to those things which outside of it are true, I recognized my not untruthful errors.",
    "My Leader, who could see that I was acting like one who frees himself from slumber, said: \"What aileth thee, that thou canst not stand up, but hast been coming more than half a league, veiling thine eyes, and reeling with thy legs, like one o'ercome by either wine or sleep?\"",
    "\"O my dear Father, if thou listen to me, I 'll tell thee what it was appeared to me,\" said I, \"when I was thus deprived of legs.\"",
    "And he: \"If on thy face a hundred masks thou hadst, thy thoughts would not be hid from me, however small they were.",
    "What thou hast seen was lest thou free thyself from opening up thy heart unto those waters of thy peace, which from the Eternal Fountain are diffused.",
    "I did not ask ‘What ails thee?' as would one, who looks but with the eye which seeth not, when once the body lies inanimate; but asked it to endow thy feet with strength; so must the indolent be spurred, when slow to use their waking time, when it returns.\"",
    "On through the vesper hours we went along, forward intent, as far as e'er our eyes could reach, against the late and shining rays; when lo, a smoke in our direction came little by little, and as dark as night; nor was there any place of shelter from it; this of pure air deprived us and of eyes.",
    "The gloom of Hell and of a night deprived of every planet, 'neath a narrow sky, darkened as much as possible by clouds, ne'er made so thick a veil before my face, nor to my feeling was so rough in tissue, as was the smoke which covered us up there; for that permitted not of opened eyes; because of which my wise and trusty Escort drew near to me, and offered me his shoulder.",
    "Even as a blind man walks behind his guide, in order not to go astray, and strike aught that might hurt him, or might even kill; so, going through that foul and bitter air, I listened to my Leader, who said only: \"Take care that thou be not cut off from me!\"",
    "Voices I heard, and each appeared to pray for peace and mercy to the Lamb of God, who taketh sins away.",
    "Their only prelude was \"Lamb of God\"; and all had but one word and intonation, hence among them all there seemed to be the fullest harmony.",
    "\"Are those, then, spirits, Teacher, whom I hear?\" said I; and he to me: \"Thou judgest rightly; as on they go, they loosen anger's knot.\"",
    "\"Now who art thou, that cleavest thus our smoke, and yet dost speak of us, as if thou still by monthly calends wert dividing time?\"",
    "These words were uttered by a single voice; my Teacher therefore said to me: \"Reply, and ask him if on this side one goes up.\"",
    "And I: \"O creature, that dost cleanse thyself, that beautiful thou mayst return to Him who made thee, thou'lt hear marvels, following me.\"",
    "\"I 'll follow thee as far as I 'm allowed,\" he answered, \"and, if smoke permit not sight, hearing, instead, will keep us linked together.\"",
    "I thereupon began: \"I go on high while in that swathing-band which death dissolves; and through the infernal anguish came I here; and whereas God hath wrapt me in His Grace so much, that He would have me see His court by means entirely out of modern use, conceal not who thou wast before thy death, but tell it me, and whether toward the pass I rightly go; and be thy words our guides.\"",
    "\"Lombard I was, and Marco was I called; familiar with the world, I loved the worth, toward which all men have now unbent their bows.",
    "For mounting upward thou art going rightly.\" He thus replied, and added: \"I beseech thee, pray for me there, when thou shalt be above.\"",
    "And I to him: \"I pledge my faith to thee that what thou askest of me I will do; but with a doubt I 'll burst, unless therefrom I free myself.",
    "Simple at first, it now is doubled by thy speech, which makes me, here and elsewhere, sure of that wherewith I link it.",
    "The world is certainly as wholly void of every virtue as thou tellest me, and is with evil big and overspread; but, pray, point out its cause, that I may see, and show it unto other men; for one puts it in heaven, another, here below.\"",
    "At first he heaved a sigh profound, which grief to \"Ah me!\" changed; then \"Brother,\" he began, \"the world is blind, and thou, indeed, com'st hence.",
    "Ye that are living still attribute upward each cause to heaven alone, as though it moved everything with it of necessity.",
    "If this were so, Free Will would be destroyed within you, and no justice would there be in having joy for good, and grief for ill.",
    "Heaven starts your inclinations, though I say not all; but ev'n supposing that I did, light has been giv'n to you for good and evil,",
    "with Free Will, which, if it endure fatigue in its first fights with heaven, will afterward, if duly nourished, conquer everything.",
    "Beneath a greater Power and better Nature ye freely lie; and that creates within you the mind, which heaven hath not in its control.",
    "Hence, if the present world go wrong, the cause is in yourselves, and should in you be sought; of this I 'll now a true spy be for thee.",
    "Forth from the hand of Him, who ere it lives delights in it, ev'n like a little maid, who weeps and laughs, and wantons like a child, issues the simple soul, which knoweth nought, save that, proceeding from a Joyous Maker, it gladly turns to that which pleases it.",
    "At first it tasteth things of little good; deceived thereby, it runneth after them, unless a guide or check divert its love.",
    "Hence, as a bit, a law must needs be set; a king must needs be had, who should at least the tower of the truthful town discern.",
    "The laws exist, but who sets hand to them? No one; because the Shepherd who precedes can chew the cud, but hath not cloven hoofs; the people, hence, who see their guide strive solely for those good things for which it longs itself, feedeth thereon, and asks for nothing more.",
    "Well canst thou see that evil leadership, and not that Nature in you is corrupt, is what has caused the world to be so wicked.",
    "Rome, which once made it good, was wont to have two Suns, which rendered visible both roads, that of the world, and that of God.",
    "One now hath quenched the other; to the bishop's staff the sword is joined, and badly needs must one fare with the other, since, together joined, neither the other fears; recall to mind, if thou believe me not, the ear of corn; for every grass is by its own seed known.",
    "Throughout the country watered by the Po and Adige, one used to find both virtue and courtesy, ere Frederick had his strife; with safety it can nowadays be crossed by any who, through shame, refrained from speech with good men, or avoided intercourse.",
    "There are, indeed, three old men still, in whom the old age chides the modern, and who long for God to give them back a better life: Corrado da Palazzo, good Gherardo, and Guido da Castello, better called, the simple Lombard, as in France he is.",
    "Say, therefore, that today the Church of Rome, by joining in herself two kinds of rule, falls in the mire, and fouls her self and load!\"",
    "\"O Marco mine,\" said I, \"thine arguments are good; and now I see why Levi's sons were from inheriting debarred.",
    "But which Gherardo is the one, who, as thou sayst, as sample of the people now extinct, remaineth to reproach this savage age?\"",
    "\"Thy speech deceives or tests me,\" he replied, \"for, thou, addressing me in Tuscan speech, seemst not to know who good Gherardo was.",
    "I know him not by other added name, unless I took it from his daughter, Gaia.",
    "God keep you, for with you I come no further! Already whitening now, behold the light, which rays out through the smoke, and I must go — the Angel 's there — ere I be seen by him.\"",
    "He thus turned back, nor would he hear me more.",
    "Reader, remind thyself, if e'er a fog o'ertook thee on a mountain, one through which thou couldst not see in any other way than moles do through the membrane o'er their eyes, how, when the damp, thick mists begin to thin, the sun's orb feebly pierces them; and quickly will thine imagination come to see how I first saw the sun again, which now was at its setting.",
    "Thus, as I mine own was matching with my Teacher's trusty steps, from such a cloud I came into the beams, already dead upon the shores below.",
    "O thou Imagination, which at times dost steal us so from outer things, that though a thousand trumpets blow, one hears them not, what moveth thee, if sense contribute naught? A light which takes in Heaven its form impels thee, freely, or by a Will which sends it down.",
    "The vision of her cruelty, who changed her form into the bird, which most delights in song, appeared in my imagination;",
    "and hereupon my mind was so shut up within itself, that nothing that was then received by it, came to it from without.",
    "Then into my high fantasy there rained one crucified, contemptuous and proud in aspect, and as such he met his death.",
    "Around him were the great Ahasuerus, Esther his wife, and righteous Mordecai, who so whole-hearted was in word and deed.",
    "And as this picture of its own accord broke up, as doth a bubble when it lacks the water it was formed withal; a maid rose in my vision next, who bitterly was weeping, and was saying: \"Why, O Queen, didst thou through anger wish to be no more?\" Lavinia not to lose, thyself hast slain; and now hast lost me! Mother, this is I, who, ere I mourn another's loss, mourn thine.\"",
    "As sleep is broken, when unwonted light strikes closed eyes suddenly, and, being broken, quivers before it wholly dies away; ev'n so did my imagining break up, as soon as on my face there smote a light brighter by far than we are wont to see.",
    "I turned around to notice where I was, when lo, a voice which said: \"The ascent is here,\" from every other interest turned my mind;",
    "and made my will so eager to behold the speaker, that, when such, it never rests until it sees its object face to face.",
    "But as before the sun, which whelms our eyes, and veils its figure, through excess of light, so likewise here my visual powers failed.",
    "\"A godlike spirit this, who, though unasked, is pointing out to us our upward path, and with his own light is himself concealing.",
    "With us he deals as one would with himself; for he that waits till asked, when seeing need, inclines already meanly to refuse.",
    "To such a bidding let us now accord our feet, and try to climb ere darkness come; for later one could not, till day returned.\"",
    "Thus said my Leader then, and I with him turned toward a flight of stairs our feet; and I, when on its first step, near me felt, as 't were, the motion of a wing, and on my face a fanning, while a voice said: \"Blessèd are the Peaceful, who are free from evil wrath!\"",
    "So high above us now were those last beams which by the night are followed, that the stars were coming out on many sides.",
    "And \"O my strength, why dost thou fade away so fast?\" I to myself was saying, for a truce, I felt, was set the powers of my legs.",
    "We now were where the flight of stairs went up no further, and as motionless we were, as is a vessel when the shore is reached; and for a while I waited to find out if aught upon the new ring could be heard; then, toward my Teacher turning round, I said: \"Say, my dear Father, what offense is purged in this ring, here where now we are? Although our feet keep still, let not thy talking cease.\"",
    "And he to me: \"The love of good, when scant of what it should have been, is here atoned; here beats again the ill-retarded oar.",
    "But now, in order that thou understand more clearly still, turn thou thy mind to me, and some good fruit thou 'lt gather from our stay.",
    "Neither Creator,\" he began, \"nor creature was e'er devoid of either innate love, or that which conscious is; and this thou knowst.",
    "The innate love is always free from error; but the other kind can err through evil aim, or through deficient, or excessive strength.",
    "While well directed toward the primal goods, and toward the secondary self-restrained, it cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure; but when it turns toward evil things, or runs to good, with more or less zeal than it ought, the creature then against his Maker works.",
    "From this, then, thou canst understand that love must be the seed in you of every virtue, and every deed that merits punishment.",
    "And now, since love can never turn its face from its own subject's welfare, from self-hate all are secure; and since one cannot think of any self as being from the First divided, and existing of itself, all hearts are thus debarred from hating Him.",
    "It follows, that, if I in arguing judge well, one's neighbor's is the harm one loves, and this is born in three ways in your clay.",
    "There 's he, who on the abasement of his neighbor his hope of rising sets, and only longs that from his greatness he may be brought low; and he, who fears the loss of power, favor, renown and honor, should another rise, and grieves so, that he loves the contrary; then he, who by injustice seems so shamed, that greedy he becometh for revenge; and such must needs prepare for others' harm.",
    "This triform love is wept for here below; but now I 'd have thee hear about the other, which runs to love in a corrupted way.",
    "All apprehend confusedly a good wherein the mind can rest, and long for it; and therefore every one attempts to reach it.",
    "If slothful be the love impelling you to see or win it, after just repentance, this present cornice tortures you for that.",
    "Another good there is, which never makes man happy; it is not real happiness, nor the Good Essence, fruit and root of all that 's good.",
    "The love that yields too much to that, is wept for in three rings above us here; but why it 's reckoned threefold I say not, that thou mayst seek the reason for thyself.\"",
    "The lofty Doctor, having ended thus his argument, was looking in my eyes, eager to see if I seemed satisfied; and I, who by new thirst was still spurred on, was silent outwardly, and in me said: \"My many questions trouble him perhaps;\" but that true Father, who perceived the wish, which, being shy, did not disclose itself, by speaking first, emboldened me to speak.",
    "Hence I: \"My vision, Teacher, in thy light becomes so keen, that clearly I discern all that thy talk implieth or unfolds; I therefore beg of thee, sweet Father dear, explain to me why thou ascrib'st to love every good action and its contrary.\"",
    "\"Direct thine understanding's sharpened eyes toward me,\" he said, \"and clear to thee will be the error of the blind who pose as guides.",
    "The mind, which is created prone to love, inclines toward everything that pleases it, when roused by pleasure to activity.",
    "Your faculty of apprehending draws an image from reality, and so displays it in you, that your mind is caused to turn to it; and if, thus turned, your mind inclines thereto, that tendency is love, is nature bound in you again by pleasure.",
    "Then, just as fire, by reason of its form, moves upward, being made for mounting thither, where, in its element, it longer lasts; ev'n so the captive mind begins to yearn, (a motion of the soul) and never rests until the thing it loveth gives it joy.",
    "Apparent to thee now can be the extent to which the truth is hid from those that claim that each love in itself deserveth praise, because, perhaps, its object in itself seems always to be good; and yet not good is every seal, though good may be its wax.\"",
    "\"Thy words, together with my heeding mind,\" I answered him, \"have shown me what love is; but this hath made me bigger with a doubt; for, if love from without is born in us, and if the soul can do naught else, her doing or right or wrong, is no desert of hers.\"",
    "And he: \"What Reason sees here I can tell thee; for aught beyond its ken, look thou alone to Beatrice, for that 's a work of Faith.",
    "Every substantial form which is distinct from matter, and is also joined with it, hath in it a specific power collected, which, save in operation, is not seen, and only shows itself in its effects, as life doth, by its green leaves, in a plant.",
    "None knows, however, whence the understanding of first cognitions comes, or whence the bent toward those first appetites which are in you, as zeal for making honey is in bees; this first will, hence, deserves nor praise nor blame.",
    "Now, that all others be conformed to this, the power which counsels inborn is in you, and ought to hold the threshold of assent.",
    "This is the source, whence comes the ground of merit in you, as it gathers in, and winnows out, your good and guilty loves.",
    "Those who in reasoning attained the bottom, perceived this inborn liberty, and left the world the teachings of morality.",
    "Supposing, then, that every love that flames within you, rises of necessity, within you lies the power to master it.",
    "This noble virtue is by Beatrice called Freedom of the Will; hence see that thou recall it, should she speak of it to thee.\"         ",
    "The moon, in rising, close to midnight late, and looking like a bucket all on fire, was causing now the stars to seem more rare; as, counter to the heavens, it coursed the paths the sun enflames, whene'er the Roman sees it setting between the Sards and Corsicans; and now that noble shade, whence Piètola hath greater fame than any Mantuan village, had put aside the load I laid on him; hence I who, as an answer to my questions, had reaped his clear and easy talk, remained like one confused because of drowsiness.",
    "But suddenly this sleepiness of mine was taken from me by a crowd of people, who, back of us, were circling toward us now.",
    "And as Ismenus and Asopus once along their banks saw maddened throngs at night, whene'er the Thebans needed Bacchus; such were those who, sweeping scythe-like round that ring, were coming on, from what I saw of them, by good will ridden and by righteous love.",
    "And soon were they upon us, for the whole of that great crowd was moving at a run; and two ahead in tears were crying out: \"Mary proceeded to the hills in haste,\" and \"Caesar, in order to subdue Ilerda, struck Marseilles, then hurried on to Spain.\"",
    "\"Quick, quick, lest time be lost through lack of love,\" cried those that came behind them, \"so that zeal in doing good may make Grace green again!\"",
    "\"O folk, in whom keen fervor now redeems, perhaps, the negligence and slowness shown by your tepidity in doing good, this man who lives, and truly I lie not, desires, when sunlight once returns, to mount; hence tell us where the nearest opening lies.\"",
    "These were my Leader's words; and one of those same spirits said: \"Come on behind us, then, and thou wilt find the hole.",
    "So keen we are to keep on moving, that we cannot stop; forgive us, then, if lack of courtesy thou deem, what we consider righteousness.",
    "I was San Zeno's Abbot at Verona, under the rule of worthy Barbarossa, of whom Milàn in sorrow talketh still.",
    "And he has one foot in the grave already, who soon will for that monastery weep, and grieve because he had it in his power; for he his son, in body wholly sick, worse still in mind, and also ill-begot, has had installed in its true shepherd's place.\"",
    "I know not if aught else he said, or ceased, so far had he run past us now; but this I heard, and I've enjoyed retaining it.",
    "Then he who was my help in every need, said: \"Turn in this direction, and behold two coming on, who give a bite to sloth.\"",
    "Moving behind them all, they said: \"The folk, for whom the sea was opened up, were dead, before the Jordan had perceived their heirs; and those who with the son of Anchises could not endure to toil unto the end, gave themselves up to lead inglorious lives.\"",
    "Then, when those shades were separated from us so far, that they no longer could be seen, a new thought made its way into my mind, whence many other different thoughts were born; and I between them so confused became, that, wandering to and fro, I closed mine eyes, and changed what I had thought into a dream.",
    "Within the hour, when, vanquished by the earth, or ev'n at times by Saturn, day-time's heat can warm the coldness of the moon no longer; when geomancers see their Greater Fortune rise in the East ere dawn, and on a path which doth not long stay dark for it; a Female approached me in a dream, with stammering tongue, with eyes asquint, and crooked on her feet, with hands lopped off, and pallor on her face.",
    "I fixed my gaze on her; and as the sun brings comfort to cold limbs which night-time chills, ev'n so my looking at her freed her tongue, and afterward, in but a little time, completely straightened her, and gave that hue to her discolored face which love desires.",
    "As soon as she had thus unloosed her speech, she then began to sing in such a way, that from her I could hardly take my gaze.",
    "\"I am\" she sang, \"the lovely Siren, she who in mid-ocean mariners bewitches; so much I please whoever heareth me!",
    "I turned Ulysses from his wandering course to hear my song; and who gets used to me seldom departs, so wholly I content him!\"",

    "\"O Virgil, Virgil, who is this?\" she cried in scornful tones; whereat he then advanced with eyes set only on the modest one.",
    "She seized the other, opened her in front, and rent her garments, showing me her belly; this woke me with the stench that issued from it.",
    "I turned my eyes, and my good Teacher said: \"I 've called thee thrice at least.",
    "Arise and come.",
    "We' ll find the gate through which thou mayst ascend.\"",
    "I rose, and all the holy Mountain's rings were with the high day's light already filled, as with the new sun back of us we moved.",
    "While I was following him, I held my head like one who, having it bowed down by thought, makes of himself a half-arch of a bridge; and then I heard: \"Come on; the pass is here,\" uttered in such a gentle, kindly way, as in this mortal land is never heard.",
    "With outspread wings, which seemed the wings of swans, he who thus spoke directed us on high 'tween the two side walls of the granite rock.",
    "He moved his pinions then, and fanning us, affirmed that \"those who mourn\" are happy, since possessed of comfort shall their spirits be.",

    "Let that suffice thee; strike thy heels upon the ground, and turn thine eyes up toward the calling lure the Eternal King whirls with the mighty wheels!\"",
    "As is the falcon, which at first looks down, then turns around when called, and spreads his wings, keen for the quarry which attracts him; such was I; and thus, as long as e'er the rock was cleft, to make a path for those that climb, I went along to where the circling starts.",
    "When out upon the fifth ring I had come, people therein I saw who, shedding tears, were lying wholly prone upon its bed.",
    "\"My soul hath cloven to the trodden ground!\" I heard them saying with such heavy sighs, that what they said could hardly be made out.",

    "\"If ye are come exempt from lying down, and wish to find the path with greatest speed, let your right sides be always outward turned.\"",
    "Thus asked the Poet, and, not far ahead, thus was the answer giv'n; hence, as he spoke, I noticed where the other speaker hid, and then I turned mine eyes unto my Lord; whereat he granted with a cheerful nod that which the looks of my desiring asked.",
    "When I was free to act as I inclined, I came and stood above the soul, whose words had made me notice him at first, and said: \"Spirit, who by thy tears art ripening that, without which one can not return to God, for my sake stay a while thy greater care.",

    "As avarice quenched our love for all good things, until well doing had completely ceased, so here doth Justice hold us in restraint, bound fast and fettered in our hands and feet; and here we 'll stay, stretched out and motionless as long as it shall please the Righteous Lord.\"",
    "I had knelt down, and wished to speak; but just as I began, and he was made aware, by listening only, of my reverence,",

    "We then accuse Sapphira with her husband; we praise the kicks which Heliodorus got; while Polymnestor circles all the Mount in infamy, who Polydorus killed; and finally, our cry is: ‘Tell us, Crassus, for thou dost know it, what 's the taste of gold?' Aloud at times speaks one, another low, as each one's feelings spur him on to speak, in stronger now, and now in weaker tones; hence I, in speaking of the good, which here is talked about by day, was not alone; but near us here none other spoke aloud.\"",
    "Already had we gone away from him, striving to make our way along the path as fast as was allowed our powers; when I, like something falling, felt the Mountain quake; then such a chill took hold of me, as he is wont to have who goeth to his death.",
    "Delos, indeed, shook not so terribly, before Latona made therein her nest, in order to give birth to heaven's two eyes.",
    "Then such a cry arose on every side, that close to me my Teacher drew, and said: \"Be not afraid, while I am guiding thee!\" \"Glory to God\" they all said, \"in the highest,\" as far as I could understand from those near by, where what was being shouted could be heard.",
    "Both motionless and in suspense we stood, as stood the shepherds who first heard that song, till, when the trembling stopped, the shouting ceased.",
    "Thereafter we resumed our holy journey, watching the shades that lay upon the ground, returned already to their wonted plaint.",
    "No ignorance had ever with as great anxiety made me desire to know, unless in this my memory go astray, as that which, as I thought, I seemed to have; I neither dared to ask, because of haste, nor could I see there anything myself; so on I went, timid and lost in thought.",
    "The natural thirst, which never can be quenched, save by the water asked for by the lowly young woman of Samaria as a boon, was troubling me, while hurry spurred me on behind my Leader o'er the cumbered path, and I was grieving for the just revenge.",
    "Then lo, as Luke records for us that Christ, when risen from the burial cave, appeared before the two upon the road, a shade appeared, and came behind us as we watched the crowd, which lay around us at our feet; but we perceived him not; hence he spoke first, and said: \"May God, my brethren, give you peace!\"",
    "We turned at once, and to this greeting Virgil replied with that which corresponds to it.",
    "Then he began: \"Within the blest assembly mayst thou be set at peace by that just court which in eternal exile bindeth me.\"",
    "\"What!\" he replied, as quickly on we went, \"If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high, who guided you so far along His stairs?\"",
    "My Teacher then: \"If thou regard the marks which this one bears, and which the Angel draws, thou 'lt see that with the good he needs must reign.",
    "But whereas she, who spinneth night and day, had not as yet drawn off for him the flax, which Clotho lays and packs for every one, his soul, which sister is to thee and me, could not, in climbing here, come up alone, because it seeth not as we.",
    "Hence I out of the ample throat of Hell was drawn, to show the way to him, and I shall show it, as far as e'er my school can lead him on.",
    "But tell us, if thou knowest, why the Mountain shook so just now, and why all seemed to shout with one accord down to its oozy base?\"",
    "Thus by his asking he had threaded so the needle's eye of my desire, that, merely with hope, my thirst had come to be less craving.",
    "The former then began: \"Nothing exists which this Mount's sacred government can feel, that void of order is, or 'gainst its wont.",
    "From every change this place up here is free; whate'er Heaven's self from its own self receives, can be the cause of it, and nothing else; for neither rain, nor hail, nor snow, nor dew, nor frost falls any higher up than lies the little stairway of the three short steps;",

    "Below, perhaps, it trembles more or less, but never quakes up here because of wind concealed, I know not how, inside the earth.",
    "It trembles here whenever any soul feels pure enough to rise, or starts to climb; and such a cry as this endorses it.",
    "Of purity the will alone gives proof, which, seizing on the soul, now wholly free to change its company, by willing helps it.",
    "It wills this from the first; but that desire which, 'gainst the will, God's Justice turns toward pain, as it was once toward sin, allows it not.",
    "And I, who have five hundred years and more lain in this woe, felt only now within me a free volition for a better sphere.",
    "That 's why thou didst the earthquake feel, and hear the pious spirits on this Mountain praise that Lord, who soon, I pray, will send them up.\"",
    "He thus addressed us; and, since one in drink delights, according as his thirst is great, I could not say how much he did me good.",
    "And my wise Leader: \"Now I see the net which holds you here, and how it opens, why it trembles here, and why ye all rejoice.",
    "Now who thou wast be pleased to let me know, and also let thy words include for me why thou hast lain so many centuries here.\"",
    "\"At that time when, helped by the Most High King, good Titus took due vengeance for the wounds, from which came forth the blood by Judas sold, I was in great renown\" that spirit said, \"up yonder with the name which longest lasts, and honors most, but not as yet with faith.",

    "Statius they call me still up there; of Thebes I sang, of great Achilles next; but 'neath this second load I sank upon the way.",
    "The seeds of my enthusiasm were the sparks, which warmed me, of that fire divine, wherewith more than a thousand poets are enflamed; I mean the Aeneid, which my mother was and nurse in poetry; and, lacking which, not by a drachm's weight had I stirred the scales.",
    "And to have lived on earth when Virgil lived, to one sun's period more would I consent than what I owe, to issue from my ban.\"",
    "These words turned Virgil toward me with a look, which, silently, \"Be silent!\" said; and yet the power that wills can not do everything; for tears and laughter follow so the passion, from which they each take rise, that least of all do they obey the will in those most truthful.",
    "I only smiled, like one who winks; whereat the shade kept still, and looked into my eyes, wherein expression is most fixed, and said: \"So mayst thou bring unto a happy end so great a toil, why was it that thy face showed me just now the flashing of a smile?\"",
    "I now am caught on one side and the other; one asks for silence, the other conjures me to speak; I therefore sigh, and by my Teacher am understood.",
    "\"Be not afraid to talk,\" the latter said to me, \"but speak, and tell him what he so eagerly desires to know.\"",
    "I therefore said: \"Perhaps thou marvellest, O ancient spirit, at the smile I gave; but I would have still greater wonder seize thee.",
    "This spirit here, who upward leads mine eyes, that Virgil is, from whom thou didst of old derive the strength to sing of men and gods.",
    "If thou hast given my smile some other cause, leave it as not the true one, and believe it was the words thyself didst say of him.\"",
    "Already was he stooping to embrace my Teacher's feet; but he said: \"Brother, no; for thou, a shade now, dost a shade behold.\"",
    "Rising, he said: \"Thou now canst understand the sum of love which warmeth me toward thee, since I forget our disembodied state, and act with shades as if they solid were.\"",
    "Already was the Angel left behind, the Angel who had toward the sixth ring turned us, after erasing from my face a wound; and he had said to us that those are blest, whose longing is for justice, and his words, with nothing further, ended this with \"thirst.\"",
    "Hence, lighter now than at the other passes, I so advanced, that I, without fatigue, was following up the spirits who were swift, when Virgil thus began: \"A love that flames, by virtue kindled, always lights another, if but its flame be outwardly revealed.",
    "And therefore from the hour when Juvenal, who let me know thy love for me, came down among us in the Borderland of Hell, my good will hath been such toward thee, that none e'er bound me more to one I had not seen; these stairs will, therefore, now seem short to me.",
    "But tell me, and forgive me as a friend, if too great confidence relax my rein, and as a friend converse with me henceforth:",
    "how was it avarice could find a place within thy breast together with such wisdom, as that wherewith thou by thy zeal wast filled?\"",

    "Thy question makes me sure of thy belief, due, maybe, to the ring where I was found, that I was in the last life avaricious.",
    "Know, then, that avarice was too far from me, and that this lack of temperance on my part thousands of courses of the moon have punished.",
    "And were it not that I corrected me, when I had understood thee in thy cry, indignant, as it were, with human nature: ‘Why dost thou not, O virtuous love of gold, govern the appetite of mortal men?' I 'd now, by rolling, feel the wretched jousts.",

    "\"When thou didst sing, then, of the cruel strife between the two afflictions of Jocasta,\" said he who sang bucolic songs, \"by that which Clio singeth with thee there, the faith, without which doing good is not enough, had not, it seems, yet made thee a believer.",

    "Thereat so holy did they come to seem, that when Domitian persecuted them, their lamentations did not lack my tears; and while I still remained in yonder world, I helped them; and their upright mode of life caused me to treat with scorn all other sects.",
    "And ere in poetry I led the Greeks to see the streams of Thebes, baptized I was; and yet, through fear, a secret Christian only, I long pretended faith in paganism; this lukewarmness around the fourth ring moved me till far beyond the fourth centennial year.",
    "Thou, therefore, that didst lift the covering veil which hid from me the good whereof I speak, tell me, while we have still a little more to climb, where our old Terence is, and where Cecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou know; tell me if they are damned, and in what ward.\"",
    "\"Both they and Persius, I and many others\" my Leader answered him, \"are with the Greek, whom more than any else the Muses nursed,",
    "in the first circle of the sightless Prison; and frequently we talk about the mount, which always hath our nurses on its slopes.",

    "There, too, may she be seen, who showed Langaa; there is Tiresias' daughter, Thetis also, and with her sisters there, Deidamaa.\"",
    "And now the Poets, both of them, were silent, intent again on looking round, since free from climbing up and free from walls; and while four handmaids of the day had dropped behind, the fifth was at the sun-car's pole, still upward pointing its burning horn; whereat my Leader: \"I think that it behooves us now to turn our right sides toward the outer edge, and circle the Mountain as our wont it is to do.\"",
    "Thus was our custom our instructor there; and with less doubt we started on again, because of that deserving soul's assent.",
    "In front they went, and I behind, alone, listening the while to what they had to say, which gave me understanding for my verse.",
    "But soon their pleasant talk a Tree broke off, which in the middle of the road we found, with fruit agreeable and sweet to smell; and as a fir-tree tapers up from branch to branch, so likewise this one tapered down, in order, I believe, that none may climb it.",
    "And on the side on which our path was closed, down from the lofty cliff a limpid stream was falling, and spraying upward o'er its leaves.",
    "Then toward the Tree the two Bards turned their steps; and from among its leaves a voice cried out: \"Of this food there will be for you a dearth!\" Then: \"More did Mary think of honoring, the marriage feast, and making it complete, than of her mouth, which pleadeth now for you; the ancient Roman women were content with water for their only drink; and Daniel thought little of his food, but wisdom gained.",
    "The primal age was beautiful as gold; with hunger it made acorns sweet to taste, and nectar every little brook, with thirst.",
    "Honey and flying locusts were the food which fed the Baptist in the wilderness; hence he is now as glorious and as great, as by the Gospel is revealed to you.\"",
    "While I, as likewise he is wont to do, who wastes his life in hunting little birds, was piercing thus the green leaves with mine eyes, my more than Father said to me: \"My son, come on now, for the time assigned to us should be more usefully distributed.\" I turned my face, and, no less soon, my steps behind the Sages, who so talked, that walking they caused to be of no expense to me.",
    "Then lo, in tearful and in singing tones \"My lips, O Lord\" was heard in such a way, that to delight and sorrow it gave birth.",
    "\"O gentle Father, what is that I hear?\" said I; and he then: \"Shades who, moving on, loosen, perhaps, the knot of what they owe.\"",
    "As pilgrim travellers do, who lost in thought, on meeting unknown people on the road, turn round to look at them, but do not stop; ev'n so behind us, though more quickly moving, there came a band of souls, who as they passed, devout and silent, gazed at us in wonder.",
    "Each was expressionless and hollow-eyed, pale in his face, and lacking so in flesh, that of his bones his skin assumed the shape.",
    "I do not think that even Erysachthon became so withered into utter skin, because of fasting, when he feared it most.",
    "Thinking within myself, I said: \"Behold the people who once lost Jerusalem, when Mary thrust her beak into her son!\" The sockets of their eyes seemed gemless rings; and he that OMO reads in human faces, would surely there have recognized the M.",
    "Who would believe the perfume of a fruit and odor of a water could so act, and cause such craving, if he knew not how?",
    "I still was wondering what so famished them, because the reason of their being lean, and of their wretched scurf was not yet clear; when lo, a shade from deep within his head turning his eyes toward me, looked hard, and then cried out aloud: \"What grace is this to me?\"",
    "I never should have known him by his face; but that to me was in his voice revealed, which in itself his aspect had suppressed.",
    "That spark rekindled all that I had known of that disfigured countenance, and thus I recognized it as Forese's face.",
    "\"Ah, prithee, heed thou not the dried up scab,\" he pleaded, \"which discolors thus my skin, nor any lack of flesh that I may have! But tell the truth about thyself, and who those two souls are, who bear thee company; refrain no longer from addressing me.\"",
    "I answered him: \"Thy face, which once as dead I mourned for, gives me now no smaller cause for weeping, that I see it so disfigured.",
    "For God's sake tell me, then, what strips you thus; make me not talk and wonder, too; for ill can he converse, who longs for something else.\"",
    "\"A virtue from the Eternal Will\" he said, \"comes down into the water and the Tree we left behind, whereby I thus grow lean.",
    "And all these people who in tears are singing, because of following unchecked love of food, are here resanctified in thirst and hunger.",
    "The pleasant odor, issuing from the fruit, and from the spray which o'er the verdure spreads, kindles in us the wish to eat and drink.",
    "And not once only is our pain renewed, as on this floor we move around — our pain, I say, though solace ought to be my word; for to the Tree doth that same longing lead us, which once led Christ in happiness to cry: ‘My God!', when with His blood He set us free.\"",
    "And I to him: \"Forese, from the day, when thou didst for a better life change world, five years have not yet rolled away till now.",
    "If power of sinning further ended in thee before the coming of that happy hour of sorrow, which reweddeth us to God, how is it thou art come up here? I thought that I should find thee still below, down there, where time restores itself by means of time.\"",
    "Whence he to me: \"My Nella, with the tears which streamed from her, enabled me to drink the pleasant wormwood of this pain so soon.",
    "She, with her pious prayers and with her sighs, hath drawn me from the hillside where one waits, and freed me from the other lower rings.",
    "So much the dearer a delight to God is my poor widow whom I loved so much, the more alone she is in doing right; for far more modest in its women is the wild Barbagia region of Sardinia, than the Barbagia which I left her in.",
    "O my dear brother, what wouldst have me say? I have, e'en now, a future time in sight, to which this hour will not be very old, when from the pulpit shameless Florence women will be prohibited to go abroad showing their bosoms with the breasts exposed.",
    "What Barbary women, or what Saracens e'er needed spiritual or other laws, to keep them covered up when going out? But if the shameless ones were sure of what a swiftly moving heaven prepares for them, their mouths for howling would be open now; for, if my foresight here deceive me not, they 'll grieve, ere that one's cheek grows hair, who still is hushed with lullabies.",
    "Now, brother, see, I pray, that from me thou no longer hide! Thou seèst that not only I, but all these people gaze where thou dost veil the sun.\"",
    "Hence I to him: \"If thou recall to mind what thou with me wast once, and with thee I, still grievous will our present memory be.",
    "Who goes before me turned me from that life the other day, when that one's sister round was seen by you;\" (and at the sun I pointed).",
    "\"Through the deep night hath he conducted me, and from among the truly dead, still clothed in this real flesh, which follows in his steps.",
    "Thence his encouragements have drawn me on, as up I climbed, and circled round the Mount, which straightens you whom crooked made the world.",
    "He says that he will make me his companion, till there I am, where Beatrice shall be; up there without him must I needs remain.",
    "Virgil is he, who tells me so,\" (at him I pointed), \"and this other one, the shade, because of whom just now on every slope your Realm, which from itself removes him, quaked.\"",
    "Speaking slowed not our gait, nor did our gait our speaking; but, still talking, we went on apace, as, by a fair wind driv'n, a ship.",
    "The shades, meanwhile, who looked like things twice dead, drew wonder through their hollowed eyes at me, when they perceived that I was still alive.",
    "And I, continuing my talking, said: \"He, for another's sake, is going up more slowly than, perhaps, he else would do.",
    "But, if thou know, say where Piccarda is; and whether I see any here worth noting among these people who so gaze at me.\"",
    "\"My sister who, 'tween fair and good, was most I know not which, on high Olympus triumphs, happy already in the crown she wears.\"",
    "This he said first, and then: \"We 're not forbid to name each here, since by our abstinence, our aspects are so greatly milked away.",
    "This Bonagiunta is,\" his finger showed him, \"the Lucca Bonagiunta; while the face beyond him, more embroidered than the rest,",
    "had in his arms the Holy Church; of Tours he was, and now, by fasting, expiates Bolsena's eels and rare vernaccia wine.\"",
    "And many more he named me, one by one; and all, when named, seemed satisfied, hence I, because of this, saw not a gloomy act.",
    "Using their teeth through hunger, though in vain, I saw both Ubaldino della Pila, and Boniface, who pastured with his crook much folk.",
    "I Ser Marchese saw, who once had time to drink less dryly at Forla, yet such he was, that he did not feel sated.",
    "But, as one looks, and more of one man thinks than of another, so did I at him of Lucca, who, it seemed, most wished to know me.",
    "He murmured, and I heard I know not what about ‘Gentucca,' uttered where he felt the wound of Justice which consumes them so.",
    "\"O soul, that seemst so fain to speak to me,\" said I, \"so do that I may understand, and with thy words appease thyself and me.\"",
    "\"There is a woman born,\" he then began, \"nor weareth yet the veil, who, howsoe'er it be reproached, shall cause my town to please thee.",
    "With this prevision shalt thou now go on; and if by what I murmured thou wast led astray, events shall make it clear to thee.",
    "But tell me whether him I here behold, who those new rhymes produced, which thus begin: ‘Ye ladies, who well know what loving is.'\"",
    "And him I answered: \"I am one, who heed when Love within me breathes, and outwardly express myself as in me Love dictates.\"",
    "\"O brother, now I see\" said he, \"the bar, which kept this side the sweet new style I hear, the Notary, Guittone, and myself.",
    "I clearly see that your pens closely follow in the dictator's wake, which certainly was not the case with ours; and he who further sets himself most to look, between these styles perceives no other difference.\" Whereupon, as if content with this, he ceased to speak.",
    "As birds that spend the winter 'long the Nile, form in the air at times a flock, and then with greater speed fly on, and in a line advance; so likewise all the people there, quickened their steps with faces turned around, since through their leanness light, and through their will.",
    "And as a man who weary is of running, lets his companions go, and only walks, until the panting of his chest has ceased; ev'n so Forese let the holy flock pass on, and saying: \"When shall I again behold thee?\" came along behind with me.",
    "\"I know not,\" I replied, \"how long I 'll live; but I shall not so soon return, that sooner I shall not with my will be on the shore; because the place where I was set to live, strips itself further day by day of goodness, and now to dismal ruin seems ordained.\"",
    "\"Now go,\" said he, \"for him I see, who most hath blame for this, behind a beast's tail dragged down to the Vale, where none e'er frees himself from fault.",
    "The beast with every step goes faster, and ever faster, till it hurls him down, and leaves his body in disgraceful plight.",
    "Those spheres have not much further to revolve,\" (he raised his eyes toward heaven) \"ere clear to thee will that become, which my words can explain no more.",
    "Stay now behind; for in this Realm so precious is our time, that, coming thus at even pace with thee, I lose too much.\"",
    "As at a gallop from a riding troop a horseman issues forth at times, and goes to win the honor of the first encounter; so he with longer strides departed from us; and on the road with those two I remained, who of the world such mighty marshals were.",
    "When he had gone so far ahead, that now mine eyes became such followers of his form, as of his words my mind, the heavy laden",
    "and living branches of another Tree appeared before me not so far away, since toward it I had only then turned round.",
    "Beneath it folk I saw with upraised hands, who toward the foliage cried I know not what, like eager children who in vain beseech, while he, to whom they pray, replieth not, but with a view to make their longing keen, holds what they long for up, and hides it not.",
    "They then departed, as if undeceived; and thereupon to that great Tree we came, which turns away so many prayers and tears.",
    "\"Pass on without approaching! Higher up a Tree there is, which bitten was by Eve, and this one is an offshoot sprung from that.\" Thus said I know not who among the branches; hence Virgil, I, and Statius, close together, advanced along the side which rises up.",
    "\"Recall\" he said, \"those cursèd cloud-born creatures, who, gorged with food and drink, 'gainst Theseus strove with double breasts; the Hebrews, too, recall, who at their drinking showed that they were soft, whence as his fellows Gideon had them not, when he on Midian down the hills advanced.\"",
    "Thus, hugging close one margin of the ring, we passed, and heard of gluttonies, which once were followed by distressful gains.",
    "Then, spreading out across the lonely path, more than a thousand steps had borne us on, in contemplation each without a word.",
    "\"What think ye three, as thus alone ye go?\" a voice cried suddenly; whereat I started, as scared and sluggish beasts are wont to do.",
    "I raised my head to see who this might be; and ne'er were metals in a furnace seen, or glass, as red and bright, as one I saw who said: \"If ye are pleased to mount above, ye must in this direction turn aside; this way goes he, who goes in quest of peace.\"",
    "His aspect had bereft me of my sight; I therefore turned and stepped behind my Teachers like one who guides his feet by what he hears.",
    "And as, when heralding the light of dawn, the breeze of May sheds fragrance as it stirs, all redolent of grasses and of flowers; so, 'gainst my brow I felt a zephyr's stroke, and well perceived the motion of the wing which made me scent ambrosian odors there.",
    "\"Blessèd are they, whom so much Grace illumes,\" I heard one saying, \"that the love of taste stirs not too great a longing in their breast, but always hunger only as is right!\"",
    "The hour was when ascent brooked no delay, because the sun had left the noon-time ring to Taurus, as to Scorpio had the Night; therefore, as doth a man who, whatsoe'er appear to him, stops not, but goes his way, if spurred by goading of necessity; so, one before the other, through the gap we entered in, and took the flight of stairs, which by its narrowness parts those who climb.",
    "And like the little stork, which lifts its wings, because it longs to fly, but ventures not to leave its nest, and lets them droop again; even such was I, with kindled, and with quenched desire to ask, when coming to the act of one who starts to speak.",
    "Nor, though our pace was fast, did my dear Father check himself, but said to me: \"Discharge the bow of speech, which to the arrow-head thou now hast drawn.\"",
    "With confidence I opened then my mouth, and said: \"How can one possibly grow lean, where need of nourishment doth not obtain?\"",
    "\"Shouldst thou recall\" he said, \"how, when the brand was burning, Meleager was consumed, this would not be so difficult for thee; and shouldst thou think how, at your quivering, your image quivers in the looking-glass, that which seems hard to thee would easy seem.",
    "But that thou ease thee to thy heart's content, lo, here is Statius; him I call and beg that he be now a healer of thy wounds.\"",
    "\"If I unfold for him the eternal view, when in thy presence,\" Statius then replied, \"be my excuse that I cannot refuse thee.\" He then began: \"If, son, thy mind shall hear and understand my words, they 'll prove a light for thee unto the ‘how' which thou dost ask.",
    "The perfect blood, which by the thirsty veins is never drunk, but stays as doth the food which from the table thou dost take away, gets in the heart a power informative for all the human members, being that which floweth through the veins to form the same.",
    "When redigested, it flows down to parts, whereof more seemly silence is than speech; then on another's blood it trickles thence into the natural vessel.",
    "There both meet, passive the one, the other active, since perfect the place from which it was distilled;",
    "joining the former, it begins to work, coagulating first, then quickening that, which it had formed as matter for itself.",
    "The active virtue, now become a soul, — as of a plant, though so far differing from it, that this is on its way, and that, arrived, — so worketh next, that now it moves and feels, like fungi of the sea; then undertakes to organize the powers whose germ it is.",
    "That virtue, son, now spreads, and now extends, which from the generator's heart derives, where Nature on all members is intent.",
    "But how from animal it comes to be a child, thou see'st not yet; a point so hard, it led a wiser man than thou so far astray, that, in his teaching, from the soul he parted the potential intellect, because he saw no organ it assumed.",
    "Open thy mind unto the coming truth, and know that, when the brain's organization is in the foetus to perfection brought, the Primal Mover, glad of such a work of Nature, turns toward it, and breathes therein a spirit new and full of powers, which draws into its substance what it active finds therein, and so becomes a single soul, which lives and feels, and on itself reflects.",
    "And that the less thou wonder at my words, consider how to wine the sun's heat turns, when joined to juices flowing from the vine! When Lachesis hath no more thread, the soul frees itself from the flesh, and bears away potentially the human and divine; mute one and all the other faculties, with memory, intelligence, and will far keener in their action than before.",
    "Then, without stopping, of itself it falls in wondrous way to one or other shore; here first it learns its road.",
    "As soon as place has circumscribed it there, the forming virtue rays round it in the same degree and way, as when the members were alive it did; and as the air, when fully charged with rain, is by another's rays, which it reflects within itself, adorned with many hues; so here the neighboring air takes on the shape the soul, which settled there, impresses on it, as would a seal, by its own forming power; and afterward, as doth the little flame, which follows fire where'er it changes place, so the new shape accompanies its spirit; which, since it hence takes visibility, is called a shade; and therewith organizes each of the senses, up to that of sight.",
    "By means of this we speak, by means of this we laugh, and by this means we make the tears and sighs, thou mayst have heard upon the Mount.",
    "As our desires and other passions move us, our shade takes shape accordingly; and this the reason is of what thou wonderest at.\"",
    "We now had reached the final circling place, and, to the right hand having turned our steps, intent we were upon another care.",
    "The bank here outwardly shoots forth a flame, while upward from the ledge below a blast is breathed, which drives it back, and keeps it off; hence one by one along the open side we had to walk; while I on one hand feared the fire, and, on the other, falling down.",
    "My Leader said to me: \"Along this path a tight rein must be kept upon one's eyes, for one might very easily go wrong.\"",
    "\"O God of highest Clemency,\" I then heard sung within the bosom of the fire, whose glowing no less made me wish to turn; and spirits moving through the flame I saw; hence at their steps I looked, and at mine own, lending my eyes to each from time to time.",
    "After the lines with which that hymn concludes, aloud they shouted: \"I know not a man;\" then in low tones began the hymn again.",
    "They cried again, this ended: \"To the woods Diana kept, and thence drove Hèlicë, for having known the taste of Venus' poison.\" Then they resumed the song; and then proclaimed the names of wives and husbands who were chaste, as virtue and the marriage state enjoin.",
    "And this course, I believe, suffices them for all the period, during which the fire is burning them; and such the care and diet, wherewith the wound is finally sewed up.",
    "While thus, one 'fore the other, 'long the edge we went, and my good Teacher often said: \"Attention pay; and let my warning help thee!\" the sun, which with its rays was changing now from azure all the western skies to white, was on my right side striking me; and I was with my shadow giving to the flame a brighter red; I noticed many shades give heed to this small sign, as on they moved.",
    "This was what started them to speak of me; and they began to say among themselves: \"That one seems not to have an unreal body.\" Then some of them, as far as possible drew near to me, though always with due care not to come out where they would not be burned.",
    "\"O thou that goest on behind the rest, though not from sloth, but from respect, perhaps reply to me, who burn with thirst and fire! Nor is by me alone thine answer needed; for all these here have greater thirst therefor than Indians or Ethiopians for cold water.",
    "Inform us how it is that with thyself thou makest thus a wall against the sun, as if thou hadst not entered death's snare yet.\"",
    "Thus one of them addressed me; and at once had I declared myself, had I not heeded another novelty which then appeared; for through the middle of the flaming road folk with their faces turned the other way came on, and made me stop to gaze at them.",
    "There all the shades on every side I see make haste, and, without stopping, kiss each other, with this short form of greeting satisfied.",
    "Thus one ant from among its dark host touches its muzzle to another's, to obtain, perhaps, directions as to path or fortune.",
    "As soon as they leave off their friendly greeting, and ere the first step has been taken there, each struggles to outcry the other shade; the new-come band shouts: \"Sodom and Gomorrah!\" the other: \"In the cow Pasaphaë reclines, that to her lust the bull may run.\"",
    "Thereat, like cranes, — if some of them should fly toward the Riphæan heights, and toward the sands the rest, these shunning ice, and those the sun, — one band departs, the other comes along; and weeping to their previous song they turn, and to the cry which best befitteth them.",
    "Then those same shades who had entreated me, drew near to me, as they had done before, with eagerness to listen in their looks.",
    "And I, who twice had seen what they desired, began: \"O souls, who now are sure of having, whenever it may be, a state of peace, my body's members have not stayed beyond, either unripe or ripe, but with their blood, and with their joints are really with me here.",
    "I hence go up, to be no longer blind.",
    "On high a Lady wins us Grace, whereby I carry through your world my mortal part.",
    "But, so may your best wish be soon fulfilled, in order that that heaven may shelter you, which, full of love, is amplest in its spread, tell me, that I may rule more paper for it, both who ye are, and what is yonder crowd, which onward goes its way behind your backs.\"",
    "A mountaineer becomes not otherwise confused, nor, looking round, grows dumb, when, rough and wild, he enters first a town, than each shade did in its appearance there; but, when set free from that astonishment, which soon diminishes in high-born hearts, the one who questioned me before resumed: \"Happy art thou, that shippest thus experience of these our bounds, that better thou mayst live!",
    "The people who come not along with us, in that offended, for which Caesar once when triumphing heard ‘Queen' cried out against him; from us they therefore separate with cries of ‘Sodom,' and by self-reproach assist, as thou hast heard, the burning by their shame.",
    "Our sin was intersexual; but, since we, by following our appetites like beasts, failed to conform ourselves to human law, to our confusion, when we leave the others, her name we cry, who bestialized herself by lying in the beast-resembling frame.",
    "Thou knowest now our deeds, and what our guilt; if who we are thou 'dst know, perhaps, by name, there is no time to tell, nor could I do it.",
    "As to myself, I 'll rid thee of thy wish; I'm Guido Guinizelli, and purge me now, because of grieving well before the end.\"",
    "As in Lycurgus' anguish those two sons became, when they again beheld their mother, ev'n such did I, though I went not so far, when him I heard self-named, who father was to me and others, better men than I, who e'er made sweet and graceful rhymes of love; hence, lost in thought, nor hearing aught or speaking, I moved, and long I gazed at him in wonder, but, for the fire, no nearer drew to him.",
    "When I with looking had been fully fed, I put myself entirely at his service with those assurances which win belief.",
    "And he: \"Thou leav'st in me a memory, from what I hear, so great and plain, that Lethe can neither wipe it out nor make it dim.",
    "But, if thy words swore what was true just now, tell me: why hast thou by thy speech and looks revealed to me that thou dost hold me dear?\"",
    "And I to him: \"'T was those sweet rhymes of yours which, while the modern form of speech endures, will e'er endear to me their very ink.\"",
    "\"Brother,\" he said, \"he whom I indicate,\" (he pointed at a spirit on ahead) was of his mother tongue a better smith.",
    "In love-songs and in stories of romance he vanquished all; hence let those fools talk on, who think the Limousin excelleth him.",
    "To rumor, rather than to truth, they turn their faces, forming their opinions thus, ere art or reason have by them been heeded.",
    "Thus with Guittone many ancients did, giving, from cry to cry, to him alone the prize, until with most the truth prevailed.",
    "If now so amply privileged thou art, that lawful is thy going to the cloister, where Christ is Abbot of the brotherhood,",
    "a Pater-noster say to Him for me, or all of it that we in this world need, wherein no longer it is ours to sin.\"",
    "And then, perhaps to yield his place to one near by him there, he vanished through the fire, as to the bottom would a fish through water.",
    "Toward him who had been pointed out I moved a little way, and said that my desire was for his name a gracious place preparing.",
    "\"Your courteous question\" he, unurged, began, \"delighteth me so much, that I can not, nor do I wish to, hide myself from you.",
    "Arnaut am I, who, going, weep and sing; with sorrow my past folly I behold, and see with joy the hoped-for coming day.",
    "Now by the Power which guides you to the top of this short flight of stairs, I beg of you be mindful in due time of this my pain!\"",
    "Then in the fire refining them he hid.",
    "As when he sends his earliest quivering beams where his Creator shed his blood, while Ebro 'neath lofty Libra falls, and Ganges' waves are being scalded by the heat of noon, so stood the sun; daylight was, hence, departing, when God's glad Messenger appeared to us.",
    "Outside the flames upon the bank he stood, and, in a voice far clearer than is ours was singing: \"Blessèd are the pure in heart!\"",
    "\"No further may ye go, ye holy souls, until the fire have burned you; enter it, and be not deaf unto the song beyond!\" he told us next, when we were near to him; hence I, on hearing him, became like one who in the grave is laid.",
    "Clasping my hands together, over them I bowed, and watched the fire, while vivid images I formed of human bodies I had once seen burned.",
    "Toward me my kindly Escorts turned around; and Virgil said to me: \"There may, my son, be pain here, but not death.",
    "Recall to mind, recall to mind! ...",
    "if even on Geryon's back I safely led thee, what shall I do now, that nearer God I am? Assuredly believe that, if within the center of this flame thou shouldst for ev'n a thousand years remain, it could not make thee lose a single hair; and if, perchance, thou think that I deceive thee, draw near to it, and make thyself believe with thine own hands upon thy garment's hem.",
    "Lay now aside, lay now aside all fear! Turn round toward me, and come ahead, assured!\" And yet, though 'gainst my conscience, I moved not.",
    "On seeing me still motionless and firm, somewhat disturbed, he said: \"Now see, my son; this wall remains 'tween Beatrice and thee.\"",
    "As Pyramus, when dying, at the name of Thisbe, oped his eyes, and looked at her, what time the mulberry became vermilion; ev'n so, my stubbornness becoming weak, I turned to my wiser Leader, when I heard the name that ever wells up in my heart.",
    "Thereat he shook his head, and said: \"What 's this? Do we on this side wish to stay?\" then smiled, as one does at a child an apple wins.",
    "Then, entering the fire in front of me, Statius he begged to come behind, who erst had over a long road divided us.",
    "When once inside, I would have thrown myself, that I might cool me, into boiling glass, so without measure was the burning there.",
    "My tender Father, to encourage me, talked, as we moved, of Beatrice alone, and said: \"I seem to see her eyes already.\"",
    "A voice that sang upon the further side, was guiding us; and we, on it alone intent, came forth to where the ascent began.",
    "\"Ye blessèd of my Father, come!\" was said within a light there, such that I thereby was overcome, and could not look at it.",
    "\"The sun is setting, and the evening comes;\" it added, \"tarry not, but hasten on, while yet the western sky has not grown dark.\"",
    "Straight upward went the pathway through the rock in such direction, that in front of me I cut the low sun's rays; not many stairs had we yet tried, when I and my wise Leaders were, by my shadow's vanishing, aware that back of us the sun had gone to rest.",
    "And ere in all of its unmeasured range the horizon had assumed one single tone, and night had everywhere diffused itself, each of a step had made himself a bed; because the nature of the Mount deprived us rather of power to climb than of desire.",
    "Like goats which, swift of foot and wanton once when on the mountain heights, ere being fed, grow tamely quiet when they ruminate, all silent in the shade, while yet the sun is hot, and guarded by a herd who leans upon his staff, and serves them as he leans; and like the shepherd in the open living, who calmly spends the night beside his flock, and keepeth watch lest some wild animal should scatter it; ev'n such all three of us were then, I like a goat, and they like shepherds, by the high rock hemmed in on either side.",
    "But little of the outer world could there be seen; but through that little I perceived the stars more bright and larger than their wont.",
    "While I was ruminating thus, and thus was gazing at them, sleep o'ertook me; sleep, which oft receiveth news of future things before they are.",
    "At that same hour, methinks, when Cytherèa, who, it seems, e'er burns with fires of love, beamed first upon the Mount from out the East, dreaming I seemed to see a Lady, young and fair, who, gathering flowers, was walking through a field, and as she sang, said: \"Know, who asks my name, that I am Leah, and that I move my lovely hands about to make myself a wreath.",
    "To please myself when at my mirror, I adorn me here; but never doth my sister Rachel leave her looking-glass, but sits there all day long.",
    "Her pleasure is to see her lovely eyes, as mine is to adorn me with my hands; seeing contenteth her, and doing, me.\"",
    "And now, before the splendid beams of dawn, which rise with greater thanks from travelers, as, coming home, they lodge less far away, the shades of night were fleeing everywhere, and with them sleep; hence I arose and saw that my great Teachers had already risen.",
    "\"That pleasant fruit, which on so many boughs the care of men is ever looking for, shall give thine every hunger peace today.\"",
    "These were the very words which Virgil used, when turned toward me; and never were there gifts, which in their sweetness could have equaled these.",
    "Such longing upon longing overcame me to be above, that at each step thereafter, I felt my pinions growing for the flight.",
    "When all the stairway had beneath us passed, and we were standing on its topmost step, on me then Virgil fixed his eyes, and said: \"The temporal and the eternal fire, my son, thou now hast seen, and to a place art come, where I can, of myself, no further see.",
    "I 've brought thee here by genius and by art; henceforth as leader thine own pleasure take; forth art thou from both steep and narrow paths.",
    "Behold the sun there shining on thy brow; behold the tender grass, the flowers and shrubs, which here the soil yields of itself alone.",
    "Until in happiness those lovely eyes appear, which, weeping, made me come to thee, thou mayst be seated, or among them walk.",
    "From me expect no further word or sign.",
    "Free, right and sound is thine own will, and wrong were not to act according to its hest; hence o'er thyself I crown and mitre thee.\"",
    "Keen now to look within and round about the wood divine, whose foliage dense and green was tempering for mine eyes the new day's light, waiting no longer there, I left the edge, and entered very slowly on the plain, across a soil which everywhere breathed fragrance.",
    "A pleasant breeze, unvaried in itself, smote me upon the forehead with a stroke no greater than a gently blowing wind; whereby the branches trembling readily were all of them in that direction swaying, where first the holy Mount its shadow casts; yet ne'er deflecting from their upright state so much, that on their tops the little birds should give up practicing their every art; but singing with full gladness, they received the earliest breezes 'mong the leaves, which sang in undertone a burden to their songs, like that which gathers strength from bough to bough, throughout the grove of pines on Chiassi's shore, when Aeolus has set Scirocco free.",
    "My slow steps now had carried me so far inside the ancient wood, that I no longer could see whence I had entered it; then, lo, a stream deprived me of advancing further, which with its little waves was toward the left bending the grass which sprang upon its bank.",
    "All waters which are purest here on earth would seem to have within themselves some mixture, if they should be compared to that one there, which hideth naught, though very darkly flowing 'neath the perpetual shade, which ne'er allows the rays of sun or moon to shine on it.",
    "I checked my feet, and with mine eyes passed on beyond the little stream, to gaze upon the great variety of flowering trees; and there, as when aught suddenly appears that turns through wonder every thought aside, a Lady all alone appeared to me, who singing went her way, and picking flowers, wherewith her path on every side was painted.",
    "\"Prithee, fair Lady, thou that in love's beams art warming thee, if outward looks I trust, which use to be a witness to the heart, let it thy pleasure be\" said I to her, \"to draw thee forward toward this stream so far, that I may understand what thou art singing.",
    "Thou makest me recall both where and what Prosèrpina was at the time, when her her mother lost, and she the flowers of spring.\"",
    "As turns around a lady who, while dancing, her feet together keeps and on the ground, and hardly sets one foot before the other; so on the little red and yellow flowers turned she toward me, no otherwise than would a virgin lowering her modest eyes; and satisfied my prayers, for near to me she drew in such a way, that her sweet tones reached me with all of their significance.",
    "As soon as she was where the grass is bathed by that fair river's wavelets, she conferred on me the gift of raising up her eyes.",
    "Nor do I think so bright a light shone forth from under Venus' eyelids, when transfixed, wholly against his custom, by her son.",
    "As smiling on the other bank she stood, her hands kept picking other bright-hued flowers, which without seed the highland there brings forth.",
    "The river kept us still three steps apart; but ev'n the Hellespont, where Xerxes crossed it, a bridle still to every human pride, endured no greater hatred from Leander, because it surged 'tween Sestos and Abydos, than this from me because it then oped not.",
    "\"New-comers are ye,\" she began, \"and hence because I smile in this place, which was chosen for human nature as its nest, some doubt, perhaps, still keeps you wondering here; and yet the psalm called ‘Delectasti' gives you light, which from your minds can drive away your mist.",
    "And thou that art in front and didst entreat me, say whether thou wouldst hear aught else; for I came ready for thine every question's need.\"",
    "\"The water and the music of the wood\" said I, \"impugn in me a recent faith in what I heard, which contradicted this.\"",
    "Whence she: \"I 'll tell thee how from its own cause proceedeth that which makes thee wonder now, and clear the mist obstructing thee.",
    "The Good Supreme, which only by Itself is pleased, made man both good and apt to good, and gave him this place as earnest of eternal peace.",
    "Through his own fault he but a little while stayed here; through his own fault, for tears and toil exchanged he honest laughter and sweet play.",
    "In order that the trouble which, below, the earth's and water's exhalations cause by their own trend, which is to follow heat as best they may, should wage no war on man, this Mountain rose up toward the sky thus far; and free from them it is from where it 's locked.",
    "And now, since all the atmosphere revolves and circles with the sphere of primal motion, unless its whirling round be somewhere broken, such motion strikes against this eminence, which in the living air is wholly free, and makes the forest, which is dense, resound; and so much power hath the stricken plant, that with its virtue it imbues the air, which by revolving scatters it about; the other land, as able of itself, or through its climate, next conceives and bears the divers qualities of divers trees.",
    "If this were heard, it would not seem to be a wonder yonder, when a plant takes root, without there being evidence of seed.",
    "And thou must know that all this holy plain where thou art now, is full of every seed, and fraught with fruit which yonder is not picked.",
    "The water thou beholdest wells not up from fountains fed by mists condensed by cold, as doth a stream which gains and loses breath; but issues from a sure and constant fount, which by the will of God regains as much as, open on both sides, it poureth forth.",
    "On this side with a virtue it descends, which takes from men all memory of sin; on the other it restoreth that of all good deeds.",
    "On this side it is Lethe called, on the other Eunoë, and worketh not, till tasted both on this side and on that.",
    "This greater is than are all other savors; and though thy thirst might be completely sated, should I reveal no more to thee, I 'll give thee a corollary as a further grace; nor do I think my words will be less dear to thee, should they extend beyond my promise.",
    "Those who in ancient times sang of the Age of Gold, and of its happy state, perchance dreamed on Parnassus of this very place.",
    "Here was the root of mankind innocent; spring's flowers and every fruit are always here; the nectar this, whereof all poets speak.\"",
    "Thereat I turned around and, having faced my Poets, I perceived that they had heard this last interpretation with a smile; then toward the Lady beautiful I turned my face.",
    "Singing as an enamoured lady would, when once her words were ended, she went on: \"Blessèd are they whose sins are covered up!\" And like the nymphs who used to go alone through woodland shades, desiring, one to see, the other to avoid, the sun; she then moved counter to the stream's course, going up along its bank, and I at even pace, matching her little steps with steps as small.",
    "Her paces were with mine not yet a hundred, when both the margins equally were bent in such a way, that toward the East I faced.",
    "Nor had we yet as far again moved on, when round toward me the Lady wholly turned, and said: \"My brother, look and listen now!\"",
    "And lo, so bright a luster suddenly traversed the mighty wood in all directions, that I of lightning was compelled to think; but since this ceases as it comes, while that, the longer it endured, the brighter grew, within me I kept saying: \"What is this?\"",
    "And through the illumined air was running now a gentle melody; hence righteous zeal made me reproach the hardihood of Eve, who, while both earth and heaven obedient were, the only woman, and but just created, could not endure to stay beneath a veil; 'neath which if she had but devoutly kept, I should have tasted those unspeakable delights before, and for a longer time.",
    "While I mid such first fruits of bliss eternal was going all enrapt, and eager still for further joys, in front of us the air 'neath the green boughs became a blazing fire, and that sweet sound was now known as a song.",
    "O Virgins sacrosanct, if I have ever been hungry, cold or sleepless for your sake, good reasons spur my claiming a reward.",
    "For me now Helicon must pour her streams, and with her choir Urania give me help to set in verse things difficult to think.",
    "A little further on, the lengthy space still intervening 'tween ourselves and them, showed falsely what appeared seven trees of gold; but when I'd drawn so near to them, that now the common object which deceiveth sense, because of distance lost no attribute;",
    "the virtue which prepares discourse for reason perceived that they were candlesticks, and heard ‘Hosanna!' in the voices of the song.",
    "Above, the fair array flamed far more brightly than in unclouded skies the midnight moon, when at the middle of her monthly course.",
    "Filled with astonishment, I turned around to my good Virgil, and he answered me with looks no less with wonder fraught.",
    "I then gazed back again at those exalted things, which toward us moved so slowly, that outrun they would have been by newly wedded brides.",
    "The Lady chided me: \"Why dost thou gaze so ardently at those bright lights alone, and dost not look at that which follows them?",
    "I then saw people who were coming on, as if behind their leaders, clothed in white; and never was such whiteness here on earth.",
    "The water was resplendent on my left, and, like a mirror, if I looked in it, reflected back my body's left to me.",
    "When I was on my bank so placed, that now only the river kept me at a distance, I checked my steps that I might better see, and I beheld the little flames advance, leaving the air behind them bright with color, and look like strokes a painter's brush had drawn;",
    "so that, above, the air remained marked out by seven long bands, all in the hues wherewith the sun his bow, and Delia makes her belt.",
    "These standards further to the rear extended than I could see; as far as I could judge, the outermost ten paces were apart.",
    "There now were coming 'neath as fair a sky as I describe here, four and twenty Elders, two at a time, and crowned with fleur-de-lys.",
    "And all of them were saying: \"Blest be thou 'mong Adam's daughters, aye, and blessèd be throughout eternity thy beauty's charms!\"",
    "After the flowers and other tender blooms in front of me upon the other bank, had been set free from that elected folk, as in the sky star follows after star, so after these, four living Creatures came, each with a wreath of verdant foliage crowned.",
    "And each of them was feathered with six wings, their feathers full of eyes; and these were such, as, were they living, Argus' eyes would be.",
    "I 'll waste no more rhymes, Reader, to describe their forms; for other spending so constrains me, that I in this one cannot be profuse.",
    "But read thou in Ezechiel, who depicts them, as from the sky's cold parts he saw them move, accompanied by wind, and clouds and fire;",
    "and such as in his pages thou wilt find them, such were they here, except that, as to wings, John is with me, and disagrees with him.",
    "The space extending 'tween the four contained a triumph-Chariot moving on two wheels, which came along drawn by a Griffon's neck.",
    "Both of His wings the latter stretched on high 'tween the mid banner and the three and three, so that, by cleaving it, He injured none; so high they rose that they were lost to sight.",
    "His members were of gold as far as bird He was, and white the others mixed with red.",
    "Not only Rome ne'er with so fair a Car made Africanus or Augustus glad, but ev'n the Sun's were poor, compared with this — the Sun's, which, when it lost its way, was burned in answer to the suppliant Earth's request, when Jupiter inscrutably was just.",
    "At its right wheel three Ladies in a ring came dancing on; the first so red, that hardly would she be noticed, if in fire she were; and such the second was, as if her flesh and very bones were made of emerald; the third one looked like newly fallen snow; and now led by the white one they appeared, now by the red; and from the latter's song the others took their time, both slow and fast.",
    "Upon the left hand four, in purple clothed, were making glad, according to the gait of one of them with three eyes in her head.",
    "Behind the whole group I have here described, two old men I beheld, unlike in clothes, but like in mien, both dignified and grave; one showed himself a pupil of that great Hippocrates, whom for the animals she loves most dearly, Nature made; the other revealed the opposite intention with a sword so glittering and sharp, that though I stood on this side of the stream, it caused me fear.",
    "Then four I saw who were of humble mien; and, back of all, an agèd, keen-faced man advancing by himself and lost in sleep.",
    "These seven were robed in garments which resembled those of the primal company, though on their heads they wore not lily garlands, but were crowned with roses and with other crimson flowers; a distant sight of them had made one swear that all on fire they were above their brows.",
    "And when the Chariot was abreast of me, thunder was heard; whereat those worthy people appeared to have advance forbidden them, and stopped there with the standards in their van.",
    "When the Septentrion of the highest heaven, — which never either setting knew, or rising, or veil of other mist than that of guilt, and which was causing every creature there to know his duty, as the lower one makes him who turns the helm to reach a port, — stopped suddenly; the people of the truth, who first had come between it and the Griffon, turned around toward the Car, as toward their peace; and one of them, as though from Heaven sent down, sang thrice aloud: \"Come thou from Lebanon, my spouse!\" and all the rest sang after him.",
    "As at the last trump-call each of the blest will quickly rise from out his tomb, and sing the Halleluiah with a voice regained; even so there rose upon the Car divine, at such an elder's voice, a hundred servants and message-bearers of eternal life.",
    "They all were saying: \"Blest be thou that comest!\" and, strewing flowers on high and all around, \"Oh, scatter forth your lilies with full hands!\"",
    "I 've seen ere now when day began to dawn, the eastern skies all rosy, and the rest adorned with beauty and serenity; and then the sun rise with its face o'ershadowed in such a way that, through the tempering of mists, the human eye could long endure it; so likewise standing in a cloud of flowers, which rose from angel hands, and fell again within and out the Car, a Lady, crowned with a wreath of olives o'er a pure white veil, appeared before me, 'neath a cloak of green, clothed with the color of a living flame.",
    "My spirit hereupon, which for so long a time had not been trembling in her presence, or felt itself all broken down with awe, with no more knowledge of her by mine eyes, but through a hidden virtue issuing from her, felt the great power of the olden love.",
    "As soon as that high virtue smote my sight, which formerly had pierced me through and through, ere I had passed beyond my boyhood's years, round to the left I turned me with the trust wherewith an infant to its mother runs, whenever terrified or in distress, to say to Virgil: \"Less now than a drachm of blood remains in me that is not trembling; I feel the tokens of the olden flame.\"",
    "But Virgil now had left us of himself deprived, Virgil, my dearest father, Virgil, to whom for my salvation I had giv'n me; nor yet did all our ancient mother lost avail to keep my cheeks, though cleansed with dew, from turning dark again because of tears.",
    "\"Dante, though Virgil leave, weep thou not yet, weep thou not yet; for thou wilt need to weep by reason of another sword than this.\"",
    "Even as an admiral, who, both on stern and prow, comes to behold the men that serve on the other ships, and urge them to do well; so likewise on the left side of the Car, when I had turned around me at the sound of mine own name, which here must needs be mentioned, I saw the Lady who had first appeared concealed beneath the Angels' festival, direct her eyes toward me across the stream.",
    "Although the veil, which from her head hung down, encircled by Minerva's olive leaves, did not allow her to appear distinctly; she went on royally, still stern in mien, as one doth who, when speaking, holdeth back his warmest words: \"Look at us well, for we, indeed, are, we, indeed, are Beatrice! How wast thou able to approach the Mountain? Didst thou not know that man is happy here?\"",
    "My lowered eyes fell on the limpid stream; but when I saw myself reflected there, I drew them to the grass, so great the shame that weighed my forehead down! As to her child a mother seems severe, so she to me, for bitter tastes the savor of harsh pity.",
    "Silent she kept, then suddenly the Angels chanted: \"In Thee, Lord, have I set my trust,\" but further than \"my feet\" they did not go.",
    "Even as the snow among the living beams grown on the back of Italy is frozen, when blown and hardened by Slavonian winds; and then, when melting, trickles through itself, if but the land that loses shadows breathe, and thus seems like a fire that melts a candle; ev'n so was I with neither tears nor sighs, before the song of those who ever tune their notes to music of eternal spheres.",
    "But when I heard in their sweet harmonies the sympathy they had for me, far more than had they said: \"Why, Lady, shame him so?\" the ice bound tightly round my heart was turned to breath and water, and through mouth and eyes issued with anguish from my inmost breast.",
    "Then she, still standing motionless upon the same side of the Car, addressed those sympathetic creatures with these words:",
    "\"Ye keep your watches through the eternal day, so that nor night nor slumber robs from you one step the world may take upon its course; my answer, hence, is made with greater care, that he, who yonder weeps, may understand, and guilt and sorrow of one measure be.",
    "Not only through the work of those great spheres, which to some end directly guide each seed, according as the stars are its companions; but through the bounty of the Grace divine, which for its rain hath clouds so very high, our eyes cannot approach them; this one here was such potentially in early life, that all right dispositions would have had wondrous results in him.",
    "But all the more malign and savage doth a soil become, when sown with evil seed and left untilled, the better and more vigorous it is.",
    "I for a while sustained him with my face; and showing him my youthful eyes, I led him along with me turned in the right direction.",
    "But when the threshold of my second age I reached, and changed my life, he took himself away from me, and gave him to another.",
    "And when from flesh to spirit I had risen, and beauty and virtue had increased in me, less dear and pleasing was I then to him;",
    "and o'er an untrue path he turned his steps, following deceitful images of good, which naught that they have promised pay in full.",
    "Nor yet did it avail me to obtain the inspirations, wherewith both in dreams and otherwise I called him back; he cared so little for them! So low down he fell, that short were now all means for his salvation, save showing him the people that are lost.",
    "I visited the Gateway of the dead for this, and unto him who guided him up hither, fraught with tears, my prayers were borne.",
    "God's high, fate-ordered Will would broken be, if Lethe should be passed, and should such food be tasted without paying first the scot of penitence made manifest by tears.\"",
    "\"O thou that art across the sacred stream,\" toward me directing with its point her speech, which even edgewise had seemed sharp to me, continuing, she began without delay: \"Say, say if this be true, to such a charge must thy confession be united now.\"",
    "My strength was so confounded, that my voice began to move, and wholly died away, ere by its organs it had been released.",
    "A while she bore it; then: \"What thinkest thou?\" she said, \"Reply; for thy sad memories are not extinguished by the water yet.\"",
    "Perplexity and fear together mixed extorted such a ‘Yes' from out my mouth, that eyes to hear its utterance were required.",
    "Even as a crossbow breaks its cord and bow, whenever with too great a tension shot, and with less force the arrow strikes its mark; so 'neath that heavy burden I broke down, and as I poured forth gushing tears and sighs, my voice more slowly through its passage came.",
    "Then she: \"Across the paths which I desired, and which were leading thee to love the Good, beyond which there is nothing one can wish, what trenches didst thou find, or hindering chains, for which thou thus must needs despoil thyself of hope of further progress on thy way? What luring charms or what advantages displayed themselves upon the brows of others, that thou shouldst pay thy passing court to them?\"",
    "Thereat, when I had heaved a bitter sigh, I scarcely had the voice to make an answer, and painfully my lips gave form to it.",
    "Weeping, I said: \"Things of the present turned with their delusive joy my steps aside, as soon as e'er your face was hid from me.\"",
    "\"Hadst thou been silent, or hadst thou denied\" said she, \"what thou confessest, no less clear would be thy guilt, since known by such a Judge.",
    "But when self-accusation of one's sin from one's own cheek breaks forth, in this our court the wheel is turned to blunt the sharpened edge.",
    "And yet, that for thy fault thou mayst be now the more ashamed, and that, when thou again shalt hear the sirens, thou mayst stronger be, desist thou now from sowing tears, and hark; so shalt thou hear o'er what a different path my buried body should have moved thy feet.",
    "Nature ne'er showed thee, nor did art, such beauty as did the pleasing members which enclosed me, and which are scattered now, dissolved in earth; hence if the highest pleasure failed thee thus by reason of my death, what mortal thing should afterward have drawn thee to desire it? At the first arrow of deceitful things thou surely oughtest to have risen up to follow me, who was no longer such.",
    "Thy wings, at least, should not have been weighed down, to wait for further blows from some young girl, or other vain thing of as brief a use.",
    "A young bird waits for two blows or for three; but 'fore the eyes of fully feathered birds a net is spread or arrow shot in vain.\"",
    "As children who are silent when ashamed, and with their eyes upon the ground, keep list'ning, and conscience-stricken and repentant are; so I remained; and she: \"Since thou art grieved because of hearing me, lift up thy beard, and thou from seeing shalt receive more grief.\"",
    "With less resistance is a sturdy oak uprooted, either by our native wind, or by the wind that blows from Jarba's land, than I at her behest raised up my chin; and when by ‘beard' she asked to see my face, I well perceived the venom in her words.",
    "Thereafter when my face was raised again, I saw that those first creatures were at rest from strewing flowers; and thereupon mine eyes, which were as yet but partially assured, saw Beatrice turned toward the Animal which in two natures one sole person is.",
    "Though 'neath her veil and 'cross the stream, it seemed to me that she surpassed her old-time self, more than she did all others, when on earth.",
    "So pricked me now the nettle of repentance, that, of all other things, what turned me most unto its love, became to me most hostile.",
    "Whereat such great contrition gnawed my heart, that, overcome, I fell; and what I then became, she knows who gave me cause for it.",
    "Then, when my heart restored my outward strength, I saw the Lady I found alone, above me, saying: \"Hold on to me! Hold on to me!\"",
    "Into the stream she had already borne me up to my neck, and, dragging me behind her, light as a shuttle o'er its top was moving.",
    "When I was near the blessèd shore, I heard: ‘Purge me with hyssop' said in tones so sweet, that far from writing, I can not recall it.",
    "The lovely Lady, stretching out her arms, embraced my head, and plunged me in the stream so far, that I was forced to drink its water.",
    "Drawing me thence, she set me when thus bathed within the dance-ring of the lovely four; and each of them embraced me with her arm.",
    "\"Nymphs are we here, and in the sky are stars; ere Beatrice came down into the world we were ordained to be her maids.",
    "We 'll lead thee to see her eyes; but, for the joyous light therein, the three upon the other side, who more profoundly gaze, will sharpen thine.\"",
    "Thus singing they began; and thereupon they led me with them to the Griffon's breast, where, turning toward us, Beatrice remained.",
    "And \"See to it that thou spare not thine eyes;\" they said, \"before the emeralds we have set thee, whence Love of old against thee drew his shafts.\"",
    "A thousand wishes hotter far than flames bound mine eyes fast to those resplendent eyes, which on the Griffon set their steady gaze.",
    "As in a glass the sun, not otherwise the two-fold Animal was gleaming in them, at first in one, then in another way.",
    "Think, Reader, if I wondered, when I saw that It was keeping quiet in Itself, while in Its image It was changing form.",
    "While, glad and with amazement filled, my soul was tasting of the food, which, while it sates, still causes thirst and hunger for itself;",
    "proving themselves to be of higher rank by reason of their deeds, the other three came dancing to their angel roundelay.",
    "\"Turn thou,\" their song was, \"turn thou, Beatrice, thy holy eyes upon thy faithful one, who hath, to see thee, ta'en so many steps.",
    "Kindly do us the favor to unveil thy mouth to him, that he may thus perceive the second loveliness which thou dost hide.\"",
    "O Splendor of eternal living Light, who, 'neath Parnassus' shades, e'er grew so pale, or from its cistern e'er so deeply drank, as not to feel bewildered in his mind, should he attempt to paint what thou didst seem, when, symbolized by Heaven's own harmonies, thou didst reveal thee in the open air?",
    "So steadfast were mine eyes and so intent on gratifying their decennial thirst, that all my other senses were asleep; and both on this side and on that a wall of heedlessness they had, the holy smile so strongly drew them with the olden net; when forcibly my face was toward my left turned by those Goddesses, for from their lips I now was hearing a \"Too steadfastly!\" Thereat the state of vision which exists in eyes but newly smitten by the sun, caused me to be awhile deprived of sight.",
    "But when my eyes were to the small accustomed, (I say ‘the small' with reference to the great resplendence, whence perforce I turned away,) I saw that on the right the glorious host had wheeled, and was returning with the sun and with the sevenfold flame in front of it.",
    "As, to protect itself, a troop revolves beneath its shields, and wheeleth with its flag, before the whole of it can change direction;",
    "even so the heavenly Kingdom's soldiery who forward were, had wholly passed us by, before its pole had made the Chariot turn.",
    "Back to the wheel the Ladies then returned; and so the Griffon drew His blessèd burden, that, though He moved, no feather of him shook.",
    "The Lady fair, who through the ford had drawn me, Statius and I, were following the wheel which made its orbit with the smaller arc.",
    "As thus we crossed the lofty wood, unpeopled because of her who trusted to the Serpent, a song angelic kept our steps in time.",
    "A liberated arrow in three flights, perhaps, as great a distance would have gone, as we had moved, when Beatrice alighted.",
    "\"Adam!\" I then heard murmured by them all; they circled then around a Tree, despoiled of flowers and other leaves on every branch.",
    "Its crowning boughs, spread out in greater width, the higher up they are, would for their height be wondered at by Indians in their woods.",
    "\"Thou, Griffon, happy art, since with Thy beak Thou tearest not this pleasant tasting wood, because one's belly writhes in pain therewith.\" Thus round the sturdy Tree the others cried; whereat the Double-natured Animal: \"Thus is the seed of all just deeds preserved.\"",
    "Then, turning toward the pole which He had drawn, He dragged it forward to the widowed Tree, and 'neath it left that part of it tied up.",
    "As our plants swell, when falls the great light, mixed with that which shines behind the heavenly Carp, and as each thereupon renews itself in its own color, ere the sun yokes up his racing horses 'neath another star; even so, a hue revealing, not as bright as that which roses have, and more than that of violets, that Tree renewed itself, whose branches once had been so bare of leaves.",
    "I understood not ('t is not sung on earth,) the hymn which thereupon that people sang, nor did I bear to hear the whole song through.",
    "If I could picture how the unpitying eyes, on hearing Syrinx' story, sleepy grew, the eyes to which much waking cost so dear; as doth an artist who from models paints, would I describe how I then fell asleep; but let whoever will, feign sleeping well.",
    "Hence to the point I pass, when I awoke; and say a splendor rent my slumber's veil, and then a call: \"Arise! What doest thou?\"",
    "As Peter, John and James were led to see some of the early blossoms of the apple, which makes the Angels eager for its fruit,",
    "and causes endless marriage-feasts in Heaven; and, overcome, recovered at the word whereby far greater slumbers had been broken; and even as they perceived their company diminished both by Moses and Elias, and all the raiment of their Master changed; so I, recovering, near me standing saw that pitying Lady who before had been the leader of my steps along the stream.",
    "\"But where is Beatrice?\" all lost in doubt I said.",
    "Whence she: \"Behold her sitting there, beneath the Tree's new leaves, upon its roots.",
    "Behold the company surrounding her; the rest on high behind the Griffon go, with songs of sweeter sound and deeper theme.\"",
    "I know not if at greater length her words were poured, because now in mine eyes was she, who hindered my attending to aught else.",
    "On the bare ground she sat, and all alone, left there to be the guardian of the Car I saw the Biformed Animal tie up.",
    "Circling, the seven Nymphs with their persons formed a hedge for her, those lights held in their hands, which safe from Auster are and Aquilo.",
    "\"Here for a while shalt thou a woodman be; then without end with me a citizen of that Rome, whereof Christ a Roman is.",
    "Hence, for the world's sake, which lives badly, keep thine eyes upon the Car, and what thou see'st be sure to write, when once on earth again.\"",
    "Thus Beatrice; and I, who now was wholly devoted at the feet of her commands, whither she wished turned both my mind and eyes.",
    "Fire ne'er descended with so swift a motion out of dense clouds, when from the highest region the rain is falling, as I now beheld the bird of Jove swoop down upon the Tree, and break not only its new budding leaves and blossoms, but its bark; with all his might he smote the Chariot next; whereat it reeled, as in a storm a ship, when by the waves to starboard now, and now to larboard driven.",
    "And then a she-Fox which from all good food seemed fasting, I perceived, hurling herself against the bottom of the triumph-Car; but, for her ugly sins upbraiding her, my Lady put her to such speedy flight as was permitted by her fleshless bones.",
    "Thereafter, whence it first had come, I saw the Eagle down into the Chariot's ark descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes; and such a voice as from a suffering heart comes forth, was that which came from Heaven, and said: \"My little Ship, how badly thou art laden!\"",
    "Between both wheels the earth seemed opened then, and forth from it I saw a Dragon come, who upward through the Chariot thrust his tail; and like a wasp which draweth back its sting, withdrawing his bad tail, he drew away part of its floor, and, keen for more, went off.",
    "That which remained reclothed itself again, as rich soil doth with grasses, with the plumes, offered, perhaps, with wise and kind intent; then one wheel and the other and the pole were covered up so quickly, that a mouth is open kept much longer by a sigh.",
    "When thus the holy Structure was transformed, it put forth heads upon its members, three upon its pole, and at each corner one.",
    "The first were horned like oxen, but the four had on their foreheads but a single horn; never had such a monster yet been seen.",
    "Sitting thereon, as boldly as a fort is seated on a lofty mountain-top, a shameless Prostitute appeared before me, with eyebrows that were quick to wander round; and then, to see that none should take her from him, I saw a Giant standing at her side; at times they kissed each other there; but since she turned her greedy, fickle eyes on me, that cruel lover scourged her from her head unto her soles.",
    "Then, filled with jealousy, and cruel in his wrath, loosing the Monster, he dragged it through the wood so far away, that with this last alone he shielded me against the Harlot and unnatural Beast.",
    "\"O God, the heathen folk are come,\" now three, now four, alternately, and shedding tears, the Ladies a sweet psalmody began; and Beatrice with sighs of sympathy was listening to their words with such a look, that Mary at the cross changed little more.",
    "But when the other maids had given way that she might speak, she rose upon her feet, and, colored with the hue of fire, replied; \"A little while, and ye shall not behold me; and then again, belovèd sisters mine, a little while, and me ye shall behold.\"",
    "All seven she thereupon before her placed, and, merely by a nod, behind her moved me and the Lady, and the Sage who stayed.",
    "She thus was going on, nor do I think her tenth step had been set upon the ground, when with her eyes she forcibly met mine; then with a tranquil face she said to me: \"More quickly come, that, if I speak to thee, for listening to me thou mayst be well placed.\"",
    "As soon as I was with her as I ought, she said to me: \"Why, brother, dost not venture to question me, now that thou comest with me?\"",
    "As unto those who show excessive reverence, when speaking in the presence of their elders, and therefore draw no clear voice to their teeth, to me it happed that with imperfect tones \"Madonna,\" I began, \"my welfare's needs you know, and that which may be good for it.\"",
    "And she to me: \"From fear and bashfulness I wish thee now to extricate thyself, that thou mayst speak no more like one who dreams.",
    "Know that the Vessel which the Serpent broke, was, and is not; but let whose fault it is, believe God's vengeance fears not human sops.",
    "Nor shall the Eagle heirless for all time remain, who left his feathers on the Car, whence monstrous it became, and then a prey; for I see well, and therefore tell it, stars now near, and from all checks and obstacles secure, which for us shall a time obtain, within which a Five Hundred Ten and Five, sent forth by God, shall kill the female Thief, and that great Giant who with her is guilty.",
    "And my prediction, which is dark, perhaps, as Themis and the Sphinx, persuades thee less, because, as theirs did, it beclouds thy mind;",
    "but facts will soon become the Naiades, which shall this difficult enigma solve, without the loss of either sheep or grain.",
    "Give heed; and ev'n as uttered by myself, see that thou teach these words of mine to those that live the life which is a race toward death; and bear in mind, when thou art writing them, not to conceal in what state thou hast seen the Tree, which twice now hath been here despoiled.",
    "Whoever robs or teareth that apart, with blasphemy of deed offendeth God, who for His own use only made it holy.",
    "For biting it, in pain and in desire the first soul longed for Him five thousand years and more, who punished in Himself the bite.",
    "Thy mind is sleeping, if it deemeth not that for a special cause it soars so high, and at its summit so inverted is.",
    "And if the vain thoughts which surround thy mind had not been Elsa water, and their pleasure as to the mulberry a Pyramus, thou, by so many circumstances only, wouldst in the interdict upon the Tree see morally God's Justice.",
    "But, since made of stone I see thee in thine understanding, and, being petrified, so dark in mind that thou art blinded by my speech's light,",
    "I also, if not written, wish that painted, at least, thou bear it in thee, for the reason the pilgrim's staff is carried wreathed with palm.\"",
    "And I: \"As sealing-wax, which changes not the shape imprinted on it by the seal, so likewise is my brain now stamped by you.",
    "But why so far above my mental sight are your desired words now flying up, it loses them the more, the more it strives?\"",
    "\"That thou,\" she said, \"mayst thus appraise the school which thou hast followed, and perceive how able its teaching is to carry out my word; and also see that your ways are removed as far from the divine, as e'er the heaven which speeds most high is distant from the earth.\"",
    "Whence her I answered: \"I do not recall that I have e'er estranged myself from you, nor am I conscious of remorse therefor.\"",
    "\"And if thou canst not call it to thy mind,\" she answered with a smile, \"remember now that this same day thou hast of Lethe drunk; and if from smoke a fire may be inferred, this thy forgetfulness but clearly proves a fault in thy desire intent elsewhere.",
    "Truly my words shall naked be henceforth, as much at least as it shall needful seem to make them clear to thine untutored sight.\"",
    "Both more refulgent and with slower steps the sun was holding now the noonday circle, which, with each point of view, moves here and there; when, even as he, who as a leader goes ahead of people, stops, if something new he find upon his path, the Ladies seven stopped at a death-pale shadow's edge, like that which 'neath green leaves and darkling boughs the Alps cast o'er their icy mountain-streams.",
    "In front of them I seemed to see Euphrates and Tigris from one fountain issue forth, and from each other slowly part as friends.",
    "\"O Light and Glory of the human race, what stream is this which from one source unfolds, and then from its own self itself withdraws?\"",
    "In answer to this question I was told: \"Pray that Matelda tell thee.\" Whereupon, like one who frees himself from blame, replied the lovely Lady: \"This, with other things, hath he been told by me; and I am sure that Lethe's water hath not hid it from him.\"",
    "And Beatrice: \"Perhaps a greater care which oft deprives one's memory of its power, hath made the vision of his mind's eye dark.",
    "But Eunoë behold, which yonder now is flowing forth; conduct him to its bank, and, as thou 'rt wont, revive his lifeless power.\"",
    "Even as a noble soul makes no excuse, but to another's will its own conforms, as soon as e'er by outward signs disclosed; even so, when she had taken hold of me, the lovely Lady moved, and then to Statius said with a lady's manner: \"Come with him.\"",
    "If, Reader, I had now more space for writing, I'd sing, at least in part, of that sweet drink, which never would have satisfied my thirst; but inasmuch as filled are all the pages planned warp-like for this second Canticle, no further doth art's bridle let me go.",
    "From that most holy water I returned made young again, as new trees are in spring, when with new foliage they renew themselves, pure, and disposed to rise up to the stars.",
    "The Glory of Him who moveth everything, penetrates all the Universe, and shines more brightly in one part, and elsewhere less.",
    "Within the Heaven which most receives His Light I was; and saw what he who thence descends neither knows how, nor hath the power, to tell; for as it draweth near to its Desire, our intellect so deeply sinks therein, that recollection cannot follow it.",
    "As much, however, of the holy Realm as in my memory I could treasure up, shall now become the subject of my song.",
    "O Good Apollo, for my final task make me as worthy a vessel of Thy Power, as Thou dost ask for Thy dear laurel's gift.",
    "One of Parnassus' peaks hath hitherto sufficed me; but with both of them I now must start upon the course which still remains.",
    "Enter my breast, and breathe Thou as of old Thou didst, when from the scabbard of his limbs Thou drewest Marsyas forth.",
    "O Power Divine, if Thou but lend Thyself to me so much, that I may show the blessèd Kingdom's shadow which in my mind is stamped; to Thy dear tree Thou 'lt see me come, and crown me with the leaves my theme and Thou shall cause me to deserve.",
    "So seldom, Father, are there any picked, to grace a Caesar's or a Poet's triumph, (the fault of human wills, and to their shame), that His Peneian leaf should bring forth joy within the Joyous Delphic Deity, when for itself it causes one to thirst.",
    "A great flame follows from a little spark; perhaps with better voices after me shall men so pray, that Cyrrha will reply.",
    "For mortal men the lantern of the world rises through divers passes; but from that which with three crosses brings four rings together, it issues on a more propitious course, and in conjunction with a kinder star, and more in its own image moulds and seals the mundane wax.",
    "A pass almost like this had made it morning there and evening here; and all that hemisphere was white, and black the other side; when Beatrice I saw turned toward her left, and looking at the sun; no eagle ever gazed at it so keenly.",
    "And even as from the first a second ray is wont to come, and upward start again, as would a pilgrim longing to return; even so to her act, by mine eyes infused through my imagination, mine conformed; and on the sun I gazed beyond our wont.",
    "Much is permitted there, which is not here allowed our faculties, thanks to the site created as the human race's home.",
    "Not long did I endure it, nor so briefly, as not to see it sparkle all around, as molten iron doth, when out of fire it issues boiling; day then all at once seemed joined to day, as if the One who can had with another sun adorned the sky.",
    "With eyes fixed wholly on the eternal wheels stood Beatrice; and I on her fixed mine, from there above removed.",
    "Looking at her, I such became within, as Glaucus did on tasting of the herb, which in the sea made him a fellow of the other Gods.",
    "Transhumanizing could not be expressed by words; let this case, therefore, him suffice, for whom Grace holds experience in reserve.",
    "If I, O Love that rulest Heaven, was only that part of me, which Thou didst last create, Thou know'st, that with Thy Light didst raise me up.",
    "When the rotation Thou, by being longed for, dost make eternal, drew me to itself by harmonies distributed and tuned by Thee, it seemed that so much of the sky was by the sun's flame set on fire, that rain nor river ever made so broad a lake.",
    "The newness of the sound, and brilliant light kindled in me a wish to know their cause, never with so great keenness felt; whence she, who saw me ev'n as I behold myself, opened her mouth to calm my troubled mind, ere I did mine to question, and began:",
    "\"With false imagining dost thou so dull thyself, that thou perceivest not what else thou wouldst perceive, if thou hadst thrown it off.",
    "Thou 'rt not on earth, as thou dost think thyself; but lightning fleeing from its proper place ne'er ran as thou, that art thereto returning.\"",
    "If I was by her little smiled-out words of my first doubt relieved, within a new one was I the more ensnared; I therefore said: \"Already sated, I had found repose from great amazement; but I wonder now how I can these light elements transcend.\"",
    "Heaving, thereat, a pitying sigh, she turned her eyes upon me with the look a mother gives her delirious child; and then began:",
    "\"All things, whate'er they be, an order have among themselves; and form this order is, which makes the Universe resemble God.",
    "Therein exalted creatures see the trace of that Eternal Worth, which is the end for which the mentioned order is created.",
    "Within the ordered state whereof I speak, all natures have their place with different lots, as nearer to their source they are, or less; wherefore toward different ports they wend their way through the vast sea of being, each endowed with instinct, granted it to bear it on.",
    "This instinct toward the moon impelleth fire; this is the motive force in mortal hearts; this binds together and unites the earth; nor doth this bow impel those creatures only which lack intelligence, but those that have intelligence and love.",
    "The Providence which ordereth all this, with Its own Light e'er calms the heaven, inside of which revolves the one that moveth with the greatest speed.",
    "And thither now, as to a place ordained, that bowstring's power is bearing us along, which to a glad mark speeds whate'er it shoots.",
    "'T is true that, as a form is frequently discordant with the intention of an art, because its matter in response is deaf;",
    "so likewise from this natural course at times a creature turns away; for power it hath, though thus impelled, to bend aside elsewhere, (as one may see fire falling from a cloud), if, by false pleasure drawn, that primal impulse turn it aside to earth.",
    "If well I judge, no further shouldst thou wonder at thy rising, than at a stream thou dost, which to its foot down from a lofty mountain's top descends.",
    "As great a marvel would it be in thee, if, rid of hindrance, thou hadst sat thee down, as rest, on earth, would in a living flame.\"",
    "Then toward the sky she turned her face again.",
    "O ye who, in a little boat embarked, have, fain to listen, followed in the wake of this my ship, which, singing, ploughs ahead, go back to see your shores again! Start not upon the ocean; for, if me ye lost, ye might, perhaps, be left behind astray.",
    "The seas I sail were never crossed before; Minerva breathes, Apollo is my guide, and all nine Muses point me out the Bears.",
    "Ye other few, who early raised your necks for Angels' bread, on which one here on earth subsists, but with which none are ever sated, ye well may start your vessel on the deep salt sea, if in the furrow of my ship ye stay, ere smooth again the waves become.",
    "Those glorious ones, who crossed the seas to Colchis, were not so much amazed, as ye shall be, when Jason turned a ploughman they beheld.",
    "The innàte and ceaseless thirsting for the Realm in God's own image made, was bearing us as swiftly as ye see the heavens revolve.",
    "On high looked Beatrice, and I on her; and in the time, perhaps, an arrow takes to light, and fly, and from the notch be freed, I saw that I had come to where a marvel turned to itself my sight; hence she, from whom the working of my mind could not be hid, as glad as she was lovely, turned toward me, and said: \"Direct thy grateful mind to God, who with the first star hath united us.\"",
    "Meseemed as if a cloud were covering us, as luminous and dense, as hard and polished, as is a diamond smitten by the sun.",
    "Within itself the eternal pearl received us, as water, though unbroken it remain, receives within itself a ray of light.",
    "If body I was (nor can one here conceive how one dimension could endure another, which needs must be, if body enter body), the more should we be kindled by the wish that Essence to behold, wherein is seen how once with God our nature was conjoined.",
    "Thère will be seen, what here we hold by faith, not demonstrated, but will self-known be, as is the primal truth which men believe.",
    "\"My Lady,\" I replied, \"as best I can do I devoutly render thanks to Him, who from the mortal world hath severed me.",
    "But tell me what this body's dark spots are, which cause the folk down yonder on the earth to tell each other fables about Cain.\"",
    "She smiled a little, then she said: \"If mortals' opinion therein errs, where key of sense unlocketh not, surely the shafts of wonder ought not to pierce thee now; for thou perceivest that short are Reason's wings, when following sense.",
    "But tell me what thou think'st thereof thyself.\"",
    "And I: \"What seems to us diverse up here, is caused, I think, by bodies thin and dense.\"",
    "And she: \"Thou 'lt surely see that thy belief is sunk in error, if but well thou heed the arguments I 'll now oppose to it.",
    "The eighth sphere shows you many shining stars, which both in quality and magnitude, may be observed to differ in their looks.",
    "If only rarity and density caused this, among them all one single virtue would more, and less, and equally be shared.",
    "Virtues that differ needs must be the fruit of formal principles, and these, save one, would, by thy way of reasoning, be destroyed.",
    "Again, if thinness caused the dusky spots which thou dost ask about, this planet would, in portions, through its bulk its matter lack,",
    "or, as a body what is fat and lean distributes, so would this one alternate its volume's leaves.",
    "If true the former were, 't would in the sun's eclipses be revealed, because the latter's light would then shine through, as when in other thin things introduced.",
    "This does not happen; hence the other one must be considered now; and should I chance to quash it, false will thy opinion prove.",
    "If, therefore, it be so that this thin part extends not through, a limit there must be, beyond which what is contrary thereto allows it not to pass; the other's ray is, hence, reflected, as color from a glass returns, which back of it concealeth lead.",
    "Thou 'lt now say that the ray seems dimmer there than in the other parts it is, because from further back reflected.",
    "From this retort experimenting, which is wont to be the fountain of the rivers of your arts, can, if thou ever try it, set thee free.",
    "Thou 'lt take three mirrors; two of them removed at equal distance from thee, let the third, placed 'tween them, more remotely meet thine eyes.",
    "Then, turning toward them, let a lamp stand so between them, as to shine upon all three, and be reflected on thee from them all.",
    "Though the most distant light will not extend so much in quantity, thou 'lt see thereby how it must needs with equal brightness shine.",
    "And now, as at the stroke of burning rays, what lies beneath the snow is wholly bared of what were previously its cold and color; thee, thus remaining in thine intellect, will I inform with such a living light, that it will quiver when thou seest it.",
    "Within the heaven of Peace Divine revolves a body, subject to whose influence lies the being of whatever it contains.",
    "The next, which hath so many eyes, distributes that being 'mong the different essences, distinguished from it, and contained by it.",
    "The other spheres, by various differences, dispose to their effects and causes those distinctions which within themselves they have.",
    "These organs of the world so go their way, as thou perceivest now, from grade to grade, that from above they take, and downward act.",
    "Give me good heed, as through this argument I seek the truth thou wishest, that henceforth thou mayst know how to cross the ford alone.",
    "The holy circles' influence and motion, as from the blacksmith doth the hammer's art, must from the blessèd Motors be inspired;",
    "and that heaven which so many lights adorn, receives its impress from the Mind profound, which turneth it, and makes thereof a seal.",
    "And as the soul which lives within your dust unfolds itself through members, which are different, and unto different potencies conformed; so likewise, multiplied among the stars, doth that Intelligence unfold its goodness, while on its unity itself revolves.",
    "Each different power a different alloy makes, mixed with the precious body which it quickens, and with which it unites, as life in you.",
    "Because of that glad nature whence it flows, the mingled virtue through the body shines, as, through a living pupil, joy.",
    "From this comes what 'tween light and light a difference seems, and not from rarity and density; this is the formal principle which makes, according to its strength, things dark and bright.",
    "That sun which erst had warmed my heart with love, by proving and refuting, had revealed to me the pleasing face of lovely truth; and I, in order to confess myself corrected and assured, lifted my head as high as utterance of assent required.",
    "But, that I might behold it, there appeared a sight, which to itself so closely held me, that my confession I remembered not.",
    "Even as from polished or transparent glasses, or waters clear and still, but not so deep, that wholly lost to vision is their bed, the features of our faces are returned so faintly, that upon a pallid brow a pearl comes no less faintly to our eyes; thus saw I many a face that longed to speak; I therefore ran into the fault opposed to that which kindled love 'tween man and fount.",
    "As soon as I became aware of them, supposing they were mirrored images, to find out whose they were, I turned mine eyes;",
    "and seeing nothing, back again I turned them straight on into the light of my sweet Guide, whose holy eyes were glowing as she smiled.",
    "\"Be not surprised\" she said, \"that I should smile at what is childish in thy present thought, since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot, but, as its wont is, turneth thee in vain.",
    "Real substances are these whom thou perceivest, assigned here for a vow not wholly kept.",
    "Speak to them, then, and hear them, and believe; for from Itself the True Light which contents them, permits them not to turn their feet away.\"",
    "And I addressed me to the shade which seemed most eager to converse, and I began, like one confounded by too great desire:",
    "\"O well-created spirit, that in rays of life eternal dost that sweetness taste, which never is, untasted, understood, 't will grateful be to me, if thou content me with thine own name, and thy companions' lot.\"",
    "Hence promptly and with laughing eyes she said: \"Not otherwise doth our love lock its doors against a just desire, than that Love doth, who wills that all His court be like Himself.",
    "A virgin sister was I in the world; and if within itself thy mind look well, my being fairer will not hide me from thee,",
    "but thou wilt recognize that I 'm Piccarda, who, placed here with these other blessèd ones, am happy in the slowest moving sphere.",
    "Our wishes, which are only set on fire by that which is the Holy Spirit's pleasure, rejoice in that our joy was willed by Him.",
    "And this allotment, which appears so low, is therefore giv'n to us, because our vows neglected were, and not completely kept.\"",
    "Hence I to her: \"In these your wondrous faces there shines I know not what that is divine, which from your old appearance changes you; hence in remembering you I was not quick; but what thou now dost tell me helps me so, that I more easily recall thy face.",
    "But, tell me, ye who here so happy are, are ye desirous of a higher place, that ye may see more friends, or make you more?\"",
    "First with those other shades she smiled a little, and then replied to me so joyously, that she appeared to burn with love's first fire:",
    "\"Brother, love's virtue sets our will at rest, and makes us wish for only what we have, and doth not make us thirsty for aught else.",
    "If higher we desired to be, our wishes would be discordant with the will of Him, who here discerneth us, which, thou wilt see,",
    "can in these circles not occur, if love be necessary to existence here, and if love's nature thou consider well.",
    "Nay more, essential to this blessèd life it is, that we should be within the Will Divine, whereby our wills become one will; and so, even as we are, from grade to grade throughout this Realm, to all the Realm is pleasing, as to its King, who in His Will in-wills us; and His Will is our Peace; and that the Ocean is, whereunto moveth all that It creates, and all that Nature makes.\"",
    "Clear was it then to me that every where in Heaven is Paradise, and yet the Grace of Good Supreme rains there in many ways.",
    "But as it happens that, if one food sate, and longing for another still remain, for one we ask, and one decline with thanks; even thus with word and act did I, to learn from her what was the nature of the web, whose shuttle she drew not unto its end.",
    "\"High worth and perfect life in-heaven\" she said, \"a lady higher up here, in whose rule the robe and veil are worn, that, till death come, both watch and sleep they may beside that Spouse, who every vow accepts, which love conforms to that which pleases Him.",
    "To follow her, when I was but a girl I fled the world, and in her habit clothing me, I promised that I would keep within her order's path.",
    "Thereafter men more used to ill than good, out of that pleasant cloister dragged me forth, and God knows what my life was after that.",
    "This other splendor also, which reveals itself to thee upon my right, and glows with all the radiance of this sphere of ours, takes to herself what of myself I say; a nun she was, and likewise from her head the shadow of the sacred veils was torn.",
    "But when she, too, was brought back to the world against her wishes and against good usage, she never from the heart's veil freed herself.",
    "This is the splendor of the great Costanza, who by the second Wind of Swabia gave the third and final Power birth.\" She thus addressed me, and thereat ‘Ave, Maria' began to sing, and, singing, disappeared, as through deep water heavy objects do.",
    "Mine eyes which followed after her as far as it was possible, on losing her, back to the mark of greater longing turned, and unto Beatrice reverted wholly; but she so flashed upon me, as I gazed, that first my sight endured it not; and this the slower made me in my questioning.",
    "A free man, 'tween two viands equally attractive and removed, would die of hunger, before he carried either to his teeth; thus would a lamb, between the ravenings of two fierce wolves, keep fearing each alike; thus would a dog remain between two does.",
    "Hence, by my doubts impelled in equal measure, if I was silent, I reproach me not, nor do I praise, since thus it had to be.",
    "I held my peace; but my desire was painted upon my face, and far more warmly thus I asked, than had it been by uttered speech.",
    "Hence Beatrice did ev'n as Daniel once, when in Nebuchadnezzar he appeased the wrath, which had unjustly made him cruel; and \"Clearly do I see\" she said, \"how both thy wishes so attract thee, that thy thought is so self-bound, that it is not expressed.",
    "Thou arguest thus: ‘If my good will endure, why doth the violence of others cause the measure of my merit to be less?'",
    "Again it gives thee cause for doubt, that souls seem to return unto the stars again, according to the opinion Plato held.",
    "These are the questions which upon thy will are thrusting equally; I'll hence deal first with that one which hath most of venom for thee.",
    "Of all the Seraphs he who most in-Gods himself, or Moses, Samuel, or, I say, whichever John thou choose, or even Mary, have in no other heaven their seats, than have those spirits which appeared to thee just now, nor for their being more or fewer years; but all make beautiful the highest sphere, and each in different ways enjoys sweet life, through feeling more and less the Eternal Breath.",
    "They did not here reveal themselves, because this special sphere had been allotted them, but to express the lowest heavenly state.",
    "Thus must one speak to your intelligence, since only from sense-objects can it learn what it thereafter fits for understanding.",
    "Because of this the Scriptures condescend to your capacity, and feet and hands ascribe to God, and yet mean something else; and Holy Church in human form presents Gabriel and Michael to you, and the other, who to Tobias once restored his health.",
    "That which Timaeus teaches of the soul is not like that which one up here beholds, for, as he says it, so he seems to mean.",
    "He says that each soul to its star returns, because he thinks that it was severed thence, when Nature granted it as form; and yet his doctrine is, perhaps, of other guise, than what his words imply, and may possess a meaning which is not to be despised.",
    "In case he mean that to these wheel-like spheres returns their influence's praise or blame, his bow may hit, perhaps, upon a truth.",
    "This principle, ill understood, once turned nigh all the world awry, so that, in naming Jove, Mercury and Mars, it went astray.",
    "The other doubt whereby thy mind is stirred, less venom hath, because its harmfulness could not conduct thee elsewhere from my side.",
    "That this our Justice should appear to be unjust in the eyes of mortals, argues faith, and not heretical depravity.",
    "But here, because your human understanding can penetrate this truth with ease, I'll now, as thou desirest, render thee content.",
    "If violence it be, when he who suffers contributes naught to him who uses force, these souls were not excused because of that;",
    "for will, unless it willeth, is not quenched, but acts as Nature acts in fire, though turned a thousand times aside by violence; for, whether it be bent or much or little, it yieldeth to the force; and so did these, when able to regain the holy place.",
    "For if their will had been as absolute as that which held Lorenzo on his grate, or that which to his hand made Mutius cruel, it would, as soon as freed, have urged them back along the road o'er which they once were dragged; but wills as firm as that are very rare! And by these words, if thou hast gathered them, as it behooved thee to, that doubt is quashed, which often would have troubled thee again.",
    "But now athwart thine eyes another pass appears, one such, that from it by thyself thou wouldst not issue, but wouldst weary first.",
    "I surely have instilled this in thy mind, that spirits who are happy could not lie, since such are always near the Primal Truth; yet from Piccarda thou mayst next have heard that Constance for the veil retained her love; she, therefore, seems to contradict me here.",
    "Oft hath it happened, brother, heretofore, that, to escape from danger, one has done, against one's will, what was not right to do;",
    "as, at his father's hest, Alcmaeon did, who impious made himself, his mother killing, in order not to fail in piety.",
    "In such a case I'd have thee think that force mingles with will, and that they so behave, that sinful actions cannot be excused.",
    "Absolute will consenteth not to wrong, but in so far consenteth, as it fears, unless it yield, to be more greatly harmed.",
    "Hence, when Piccarda puts the matter thus, she means it of the will that 's absolute, and of the other I; hence both speak true.",
    "Such was the rippling of the holy stream, which issued from the Fount whence every truth derives; and such, it set both doubts at rest.",
    "\"O thou belovèd of the Primal Lover, O goddess,\" said I then, \"whose speech both warms and inundates me so, that more and more it quickens me with life, not deep enough is m? love to return thee grace for grace; but let Who sees and can, provide for this.",
    "I well see that our mind is never sated, unless it be illumined by the Truth, outside of which no truth extends.",
    "Therein it rests, as doth a wild beast in its lair, as soon as it attains it; and it can attain it; else would all desires be vain.",
    "Hence like a shoot doubt rises at the foot of truth; and this is Nature, which from height to height impels us toward the mountain's top.",
    "This biddeth me, and this assurance gives me, Lady, with reverence to inquire of you about another truth that 's dark to me.",
    "I wish to know if one can so content you for broken vows by means of other things, that these shall not prove light upon your scales.\"",
    "Then Beatrice looked at me with her eyes filled so divinely with the sparks of love, that, overcome, my vision turned in flight, and I with bowed eyes almost lost myself.",
    "\"If in the heat of love I flame on thee beyond the measure which is seen on earth, and vanquish thus the power of thine eyes, wonder thou not thereat, for this proceeds from perfect sight, which, as it sees, directs its feet to penetrate the good perceived.",
    "I clearly see that in thine intellect the Light Eternal is already shining, which, if but seen, always enkindles love; and if aught else seduce the love of men, 't is nothing but some vestige of that Light, which there, ill-recognized, is shining through.",
    "Thou now wouldst know if for an unkept vow, one could with other service pay enough, 'gainst prosecution to ensure the soul.\"",
    "'T was thus that Beatrice began this canto; and ev'n as one who cuts not short his speech, her holy argument continued thus:",
    "\"The greatest gift which, of His bounty, God bestowed, when He created, and the nearest like His own Goodness, and the one most prized",
    "by Him, was Freedom of the Will, wherewith all creatures with intelligence, and they alone, both were and are endowed.",
    "Now, if from this thou argue, thou 'lt perceive a vow's high value, if so made it be, that God gives His consent, when thou giv'st thine; for when this pact is closed 'tween God and man a sacrifice is made of this great treasure, whereof I speak, and made by its own act.",
    "What, then, in compensation can be given? In thinking thou canst use thine offering well, good wouldst thou do with wrongly gotten gain.",
    "On the chief question thou art now informed; but since in this thing Holy Church exempts, which seems against the truth I showed to thee, a little longer must thou sit at table, because the solid food which thou hast taken, requires for thy digestion further help.",
    "Open thy mind to what I now reveal, and fix it therewithin; for having heard without retaining doth not knowledge make.",
    "In the essence of this sacrifice two things combine; one, that whereof the sacrifice is made; the other is the pact itself.",
    "This last can never cancelled be, except by being kept; and very definite concerning this is what was said above.",
    "The Hebrews, therefore, were alone compelled to make an offering, though their offer might, in some events, be changed, as thou must know.",
    "The other, which thou knowest as its matter, may well be such, that there will be no sin, if for some other matter it be changed.",
    "But at his own free will let no one shift the burden he has placed upon his back, unless the white and yellow Keys are turned; and let him deem all permutations foolish, unless the thing abandoned be contained in that which is assumed, as four in six.",
    "Whatever, then, weighs by its worth so much, that it can cause all scales to tip, can not, by any other spending, be made good.",
    "Let mortals not act lightly with their vows! Be faithful, and in this thing be not thoughtless, as Jephthah was, when offering up ‘the first,' who should have said: ‘I wrongly did,' than keep his vow, and so do worse; and thou mayst deem as impious that great leader of the Greeks, because of whom Iphigenaa mourned for her fair face, and for herself made fools and wise men weep, who heard of such a rite.",
    "Ye Christians, be more serious when ye act! Be not like feathers in all winds, nor think that any water will avail to cleanse you!",
    "Ye have the Testaments, both Old and New, to guide you, and the Shepherd of the Church; let this for your salvation be enough.",
    "If evil greed should teach you otherwise, be men, and not like undiscerning sheep, that in your midst no Jew may laugh at you.",
    "Nor do as doth a little lamb, that leaves its mother's milk, and like a wanton fool, against itself for its own pleasure fights.\"",
    "Thus Beatrice to me, even as I write; then full of eagerness she turned in that direction, where the world is most alive.",
    "Her silence and her change of countenance silence imposed upon my eager mind, which had ahead of it new questions now.",
    "Then as an arrow doth, which strikes the mark, before the bowstring is at rest, even so did we speed on into the second realm.",
    "So joyous did I see my Lady there, as into that heaven's light she entered, that, because of it, the planet brighter grew.",
    "And if the star was changed and smiled, what, then, did I become, who, by my very nature, in all ways am susceptible of change!",
    "As in a fishpond which is still and clear, the fish draw near to that which from without so cometh, that they take it for their food;",
    "I thus saw far more than a thousand splendors approaching us, and there was heard in each: \"Lo, here is one, who shall increase our loves.\" And as each one came up to me, the shade was seen replete with joy within the bright effulgence issuing from its midst.",
    "Think, Reader, if what here is entered on should not proceed, how full of pain would be thy craving to know more; and by thyself thou 'lt see how great was my desire to hear from these, about the state of their existence, as soon as to mine eyes they were revealed.",
    "\"O well-born spirit, to whom Grace permits to see the thrones of Heaven's eternal triumph, ère thy life militant be left behind, we by the light throughout all Heaven diffused are kindled; hence, wouldst thou inform thyself respecting us, be sated at thy will.\"",
    "Thus was it said to me by one of those kind spirits; and by Beatrice: \"Speak, speak, with freedom, and, as thou wouldst gods, believe!\"",
    "\"I clearly see how thou in thine own light dost nest thyself, and from thine eyes dost flash it, they beam so radiantly, when thou dost smile; but who thou art I know not, nor why thou, deserving soul, hast that sphere's grade, which veils itself from mortals with another's rays.\"",
    "Thus I, when I had turned me toward the light which had addressed me first; far brighter then it made itself than it had been before.",
    "As doth the sun, which by exceeding splendor itself conceals itself, whene'er its heat has gnawed away the tempering of dense mists; so by increase of joy that holy form in its own radiance hid itself from me; and, wholly thus wrapped up, in such a way replied to me, as sings the following song.",
    "When Constantine had turned the Eagle back, counter the course of heaven its flight pursued behind the Ancient who Lavinia wedded, a hundred and a hundred years and more the Bird of God on Europe's verge abode, hard by the mountains whence it issued first; and 'neath the shadow of its sacred plumes it governed there the world from hand to hand, and, changing thus, reached mine.",
    "Caesar I was, and am Justinian, he, who by the will of that First Love which now I feel, withdrew the useless and excessive from the laws.",
    "And I, before attending to this work, believed that Christ one only nature had, not more, and was with such a faith content; but blessèd Agapètus, who was then the highest Shepherd, set me by his words upon the pathway of the genuine faith.",
    "Him I believed, and what was in his faith I now see clearly, even as thou dost see that contradictions are both false and true.",
    "As soon as with the Church I moved my feet, God, of His Grace, with that great task was pleased to inspire me, and thereto I gave me wholly; war to my Belisarius I entrusted, to whom Heaven's right hand was so well conjoined, it seemed a sign that from it I should rest.",
    "Here, then, to thy first question ends my answer; its nature, though, constrains me to go on with something more, that thou mayst see how rightly against the holy Standard moves both who appropriates, and who opposes, it.",
    "See what great virtue caused it to deserve respect; for from that moment it began, when Pallas died to give it sovereignty.",
    "Thou knowest that in Alba it sojourned three hundred years and more, till finally three against three fought for its sake again; thou knowest, too, what from the Sabines' wrong, through seven kings, till Lucretia's grief, it did, conquering the neighboring peoples all around.",
    "Thou knowest what it did, 'gainst Brennus borne, and Pyrrhus, and against the other Kings and self-ruled States, by Rome's elect, whereby Torquatus, Quinctius, for his unkempt locks surnamed, the Decii and Fabii, acquired the fame which gladly I embalm.",
    "It brought the pride of those Arabians low, who traversed, in the wake of Hannibal, those Alpine rocks, whence thou, Po, glidest down.",
    "Scipio and Pompey triumphed under it when young; and bitter to that hill it seemed, beneath which thou wast born.",
    "Then, near the time when willed it was by Heaven, that all the world should be reduced to its own peaceful state, Caesar assumes it at the hest of Rome.",
    "And that which from the Var unto the Rhine it did, the Saône, Isère and Seine perceived, and every valley whence the Rhone is filled.",
    "What next it did, when, issuing from Ravenna, it leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight, that neither tongue nor pen could follow it.",
    "Toward Spain it wheeled its host around; then turned Durazzo-ward; and smote Pharsalia so, that to the torrid Nile the pain was felt.",
    "Antandros and the Samois, whence it started, it saw again, and there where Hector lies; then, ill for Ptolemy, it roused itself.",
    "Thence with the speed of lightning it swooped down on Juba: toward your West it next turned back, for there it heard Pompeian trumpets blow.",
    "For what it did with its next Standard-bearer, Brutus, and Cassius with him, barks in Hell; Mòdena and Perugia, too, it grieved.",
    "Sad Cleopatra, who, before it fleeing, took from the asp a dark and sudden death, is weeping still for what with him it did.",
    "With him it reached the distant Red Sea's shore; with him it brought the world to such a state of peace, that Janus had his temple closed.",
    "But what the Sign which causes me to speak, had done before, and after was to do, throughout the mortal world which owns its sway, comes to seem small and dark, if in the hand of its third Caesar it be looked upon with clearly seeing eyes and spirit pure; because the Living Justice which inspires me, granted that Sign, when in the latter's hand, the glory of carrying out its wrath's revenge.",
    "Now wonder here at what I further tell thee: when this was done, with Titus it ran on to avenge the avenging of the ancient sin.",
    "And later, when the tooth of Lombardy the Holy Church had bitten, Charles the Great came to her help by conquering 'neath its wings.",
    "Thou now canst judge of those I charged above, and of their sins, which all your woes produced.",
    "Against the public Standard one sets up the yellow Fleur-de-lys, while yet another appropriates it to a party's use; hence hard it is to see which sinneth most.",
    "Let, then, the Ghibellines their tricks perform under some other sign; for this one he e'er follows ill, who it from justice parts! Nor let this new Charles smite it with his Guelfs, but let him rather fear the taloned claws, which from a greater lion once stripped off his hide! Often have sons ere now bewailed their father's guilt; hence let none think that God will for his Lilies change His Coat-of-arms!",
    "This little star of ours adorns itself with those good spirits who have active been, that fame and honor might live after them; and when, thus deviating, one's desires tend thitherward, the rays of true love needs must upward mount with less intensity.",
    "But in the balancing of our rewards with our deserts, part of our joy consists, because we see them as nor more nor less.",
    "Hereby the Living Justice sweetens so our love in us, that it can nevermore be turned aside to any kind of wrong.",
    "Voices that differ make on earth sweet music; so in this life of ours its different grades produce sweet harmony among these spheres.",
    "And in the present pearl there shines the light of Romeo, he whose beautiful and great performance was ungratefully repaid.",
    "And yet the Provençals who 'gainst him worked, laugh not; he, therefore, takes an evil path, who to his harm another's good deeds turns.",
    "Four daughters, and each one of them a queen, had Raymond Berenger; and, though low-born and alien, Romeo 't was did this for him; then slandering words led Raymond to demand a reckoning of this upright man, who five and seven had rendered him for every ten.",
    "Thereat, though poor and old, he went his way; and if the world but knew the heart he had, while crust by crust he begged his livelihood, much as it praises, it would praise him more!\"",
    "\"Hosanna, O Thou Holy God of Hosts, that with Thy Clarity dost brighter make the happy fires of these celestial realms!\"",
    "As thus to his own song he turned himself, by me that substance was seen singing now, o'er which a double light two-folds itself; and to their dance both that one and the rest addressed themselves; and then, like swiftest sparks, with sudden distance veiled themselves from me.",
    "In doubt I was, and to myself kept saying: \"Tell, tell it to her; tell\" I said, \"my Lady, who with her sweet distillings slakes my thirst!\"",
    "That reverence, though, which masters all of me by the mere syllables of be and ace, bowed me like one that 's overcome by sleep.",
    "A short while Beatrice endured me thus; then, lighting up my face with such a smile, as, even in fire, would bless one, she began:",
    "\"As I am unmistakably aware, how a just vengeance could have been avenged with justice, hath occasioned thee to doubt;",
    "but I shall quickly liberate thy mind; hence listen, for my words will now bestow on thee the present of a mighty truth.",
    "By not accepting for the power that wills a helpful curb, the man who was not born, damning himself, damned all his progeny; wherefore the human race lay sick below in serious sin for many centuries, until the Word of God was pleased descend to where the nature, which had wandered far from its Creator, to His Self He joined, by the mere act of His Eternal Love.",
    "Now turn thy sight to what is argued now! This nature, thus united to its Maker, was, as when first created, pure and good; but through its own fault was in banishment exiled from Paradise, because it turned out of the path of truth and its own life.",
    "As to the suffering, therefore, which the cross afforded, none so justly ever bit, if measured by the nature thus assumed; and likewise none was ever so unjust, considering who the person was that suffered, within whom such a nature was conjoined.",
    "From one act, therefore, issued things diverse; for one same death pleased both the Jews, and God; it caused the earth to quake, and opened Heaven.",
    "No longer strange should it appear to thee henceforth, when it is said a just revenge was by a just court afterward avenged.",
    "But I perceive that now, from thought to thought, thy mind is in a knot tied up, from which with great desire it seeks to free itself.",
    "Thou sayest: ‘What I hear I clearly see; but from me hidden is why God should will for our redemption just this way alone.' Buried, my brother, lieth this decree from all men's eyesight, whose intelligence hath not in love's flame reached maturity.",
    "However, inasmuch as on this mark great is the gazing, and but little seen, I 'll say why this one was the worthiest way.",
    "Goodness Divine, which spurneth from Itself all envy, burning in Itself, so sparkles, that Its eternal beauties It displays.",
    "Whatever from It is immediately distilled, hath afterward no end; for when It sets Its seal, Its stamp is not removed.",
    "Whatever from It is immediately rained down, is wholly free, for that lies not under the power of secondary things.",
    "Since most like It, it gives It greatest pleasure; because the Holy Fire which lighteth all things, is brightest in what most resembles It.",
    "The human creature is by all these things advantaged; hence, if one of them be lacking, it needs must fall from its nobility.",
    "Nothing but sin deprives it of its freedom, and maketh it unlike the Highest Good, hence little is it whitened by Its Light; and to its dignity it ne'er returns, unless, where sin has emptied, it fill up, for evil pleasures, with just penalties.",
    "When in its seed your nature wholly sinned, it was of all these dignities deprived, as well as banished far from Paradise; nor could they be regained by any path, if with due subtlety thou pay attention, except by crossing one of these two fords: either that of His courtesy alone, God should forgive it, or that by itself mankind should for its folly make amends.",
    "Fixed as attentively upon my words as thou art able, thrust thou now thine eye within the Eternal Counsel's deep abyss!",
    "Since finite, man could never make amends, because unable in humility, by new obedience, to descend as far, as, disobeying, he had meant to mount; and this the reason is why man was barred from making satisfaction by himself.",
    "It, hence, behooved that God by His own ways should reinstate man in his perfect life, by one, I mean, or else by both at once.",
    "But since so much more grateful is the work a workman does, the more it represents the goodness of the heart from which it comes, Goodness Divine, which on the world imprints Its seal, was pleased to move by all Its paths to raise you up again.",
    "Nor hath there been, nor will there ever be, by either way, between the first of days and last of nights, so high and so magnificent a plan; for God was far more bountiful in giving Himself, to make man fit to raise himself, than had He only of Himself forgiven; therefore all other means had fallen short of Justice, if the Son of God had not humbled Himself, incarnate to become.",
    "But, wholly to fulfill thine every wish, I 'll now go back to clarify one point, that thou mayst see as plainly there as I.",
    "Thou say'st: ‘I see that water, nay, I see that fire and air and earth, and all their mixtures become corrupt, and but a little while endure; and yet created things were these! If, therefore, what was said above were true, safe from corruption ought these things to be.'",
    "The Angels, brother, and the perfect world, in which thou now art, may be called created, such as they are, in their perfected state; the elements, however, thou hast named, and those things which by means of them are made, by a created virtue are informed.",
    "Created was the matter which they have; created was the informing influence in all these stars, which round about them move.",
    "The rays and motion of the holy lights draw from pure matter's potentiality the soul of every brute and every plant.",
    "But without agency doth Kindliness Supreme breathe your life forth, and with Itself enamors it so greatly, that thereafter it always longs for It.",
    "And, furthermore, thou canst from this infer your resurrection, if thou recall how human flesh was made, when both of man's first parents were created.\"",
    "The world was at its peril wont to think that, in the third of epicycles circling, fair Cypria beamed her sensual love abroad; the ancient peoples, therefore, in their ancient error, with sacrifice and votive cry, honored not her alone, but with Diòne Cupid as well, the former as her mother, the latter as her son; and used to say that he had sat of old in Dido's lap; and took from her, from whom I here begin, the name-word of the star, at which the sun looks fondly, now behind, and now in front.",
    "Of our ascending to it I was not aware; but that we in it were, my Lady, whom grown more fair I saw, assured me fully.",
    "And then, as in a flame a spark is seen, and as within a voice a voice is heard, when one remains and the other goes and comes; so I in that light other lamps beheld, whirling with greater speed or less, I think, according to each lamp's eternal vision.",
    "Out of cold clouds there ne'er descended winds, or visible or not, so swiftly moving, that they would not appear restrained and slow to one who had perceived those lights divine draw near to us, when they had ceased the circling, among the exalted Seraphs first begun.",
    "And in the foremost to appear, \"Hosanna\" resounded so, that I have never since lacked the desire of hearing it again.",
    "One then drew nearer to us, and alone began: \"We all are ready at thy pleasure, that thou mayst have thy joy of all of us.",
    "In one ring, with one circling and one thirst, we with the heavenly Principalities revolve, to whom once from the world thou saidst: ‘Ye who the third heaven by your knowledge move;' and we 're so full of love, that, thee to please, a little quiet will not seem less sweet.\"",
    "After mine eyes had toward my Lady turned with reverent questioning, and she herself had with herself contented and assured them, back toward the light they turned, which of itself had made such promise, and \"Who are ye, say?\" was what I voiced with great affection toned.",
    "And how much greater did I see it grow, in size and quality, with that new joy, which, when I spoke, was added to its joys!",
    "Grown thus, it said to me: \"The world below had me not long; but had it done so longer, much evil that will be, would not have been.",
    "The gladness which around me radiates, and, like a creature by its own silk swathed, conceals me here, now keeps me hidden from thee.",
    "Much didst thou love me, and good cause hadst thou therefor; since, had I been on earth, much more would I have shown thee than the leaves of love.",
    "That left-hand bank, which by the Rhone is washed, just after it has mingled with the Sorgue, looked in due time to have me as its lord; as did the Ausonian horn, which is with Bari, Gaèta and Crotona towned, and whence the Tronto and Verde pour into the sea.",
    "Upon my brow already blazed the crown of that land which the Danube irrigates, when it abandons its Germanic banks; and fair Trinacria, which grows dark with smoke between Pachynus' and Pelorus' capes over the gulf which Eurus vexes most, not through Typhoèus, but through nascent sulphur, would still be waiting for its kings, through me from Charles and Rudolph sprung, had not ill rule, which always angers subject peoples, stirred Palermo to the point of shouting: \"Die!\"",
    "And did my brother but foresee this now, the greedy poverty would he avoid of Catalonia, that it harm him not; for verily provision must be made by him, or by another, that no load be further laid upon his burdened bark.",
    "His nature, which descended mean from one which liberal was, would such retainers need, as would not care to fill their coffers up.",
    "\"Since I, my lord, believe the joy profound thy speech infuses in me, is by thee perceived, where every good thing both begins and ends, as I perceive it, all the more grateful it is; and I am also glad that this thou see'st by looking up at God.",
    "As thou hast made me happy, make it clear, for thou hast moved me by thy words to doubt, how out of sweet seed bitter seed can spring.\"",
    "This I to him; and he: \"If I can show a truth to thee, to that which thou dost ask thou 'lt hold thy face, as thou dost now thy back.",
    "The Good which turns and sateth all the Realm through which thou mountest, makes His providence a power within these mighty bodies here; and not alone are natures in that Mind foreseen, which of Its own self perfect is, but they themselves, and with them their well-being;",
    "hence, all this bow shoots forth falls predisposed unto an end foreseen, as would an arrow aimed at its destined mark.",
    "Were this not so, the heaven through which thou now art journeying, in such a way would its effects produce, that ruins they would be, not works of art; nor can this be, unless the Intellects which move these stars are faulty, and the First, who failed to make them perfect, faulty, too.",
    "Wouldst have this truth become more white for thee?\"",
    "And I: \"No, truly, for I see that Nature, in what is needful, cannot get fatigued.\"",

    "\"Yes,\" I replied, \"nor do I here ask why.\"",
    "\"And can he be, unless men there below in different ways for different functions live? No, if thereon your teacher writeth well.\"",
    "So far he came, deducing thus; then closed: \"Because of this the roots of your effects must different be; hence one is Solon born, Xerxes another, and Melchisedech another, and another he, who lost his son while flying through the air.",
    "Revolving Nature, which is a seal to mortal wax, performs her function well, but no distinction makes 'tween one and any other dwelling-place.",
    "It hence results that Esau in his seed differs from Jacob, while Quirinus comes from such a common father, that ascribed to Mars he is.",
    "A generated nature, unless divine foresight prevailed, would always follow along its generators' path.",

    "Nature, whene'er she finds a destiny discordant with her, like all other seed in soil unsuited to it, always fails; and if the world down there but set its mind upon the basal plan which Nature lays, and followed it, 't would have its people good.",
    "But to religion ye now wrest aside one that is born to gird him with a sword; and make a king of one that 's fit to preach; the course ye take is, therefore, off the road.\"",
    "After thy Charles, fair Clemence, had resolved my doubts, he told me of the treacheries, his offspring were to undergo; and said: \"Be silent now, and let the years roll by!\" Hence I can only say to you that tears will justly follow on your people's wrongs.",
    "And now the spirit of that holy light back to the Sun, which filleth it, had turned, as to the Good which sateth everything.",
    "Alas, ye souls deceived and impious creatures, who from such goodness tear your hearts away, and turn your temples unto vanity!",
    "And hereupon, another of those splendors in my direction came, and signified, by brightening outwardly, its wish to please me.",
    "The eyes of Beatrice, which, as before, were fixed upon me, gave me full assurance of her beloved assent to my desire.",
    "\"Prithee, blest spirit, satisfy my wish at once,\" I therefore said, \"and give me proof that what I think, I can reflect in thee.\"",
    "Whereat the light which still was new to me, out of its depths, whence it had sung before, went on, like one whom doing good delights: \"In that part of Italia's evil land, which 'tween Rialto's island and the Brenta's and Piave's fountain-heads is situated, a hill ascends, nor rises very high, whence once a torch came down, which terribly assaulted all the country round about.",

    "But gladly I forgive myself the cause of my allotment here, which grieves me not; which to your common people might seem strange.",
    "Of this dear brilliant jewel of our heaven, which nearest is to me, a mighty fame remains behind; and, ere it die away, this hundredth year will yet quintupled be.",
    "See whether one should excellent become, so that the first may leave another life! But thus the present mob, the Adige's and Tagliamento's streams enclose, thinks not; nor doth it yet, though scourged by wars, repent.",
    "But at the Marsh 't will happen soon that Padua will change the waters which Vicenza bathe, because its folk were restive to their duty.",

    "Too large would be the wine-vat which could hold all the Ferrara blood — and weary one who tried to weigh it ounce by ounce — which shall this courteous priest's donation be, to prove his party loyalty; and gifts like this will with the country's life conform.",

    "She here ceased speaking; then intent she seemed on something else, because she set herself to wheel around, as previously she did.",
    "The other joy, already known to me as something noble, in my sight became a perfect ruby smitten by the sun.",

    "\"God seeth all,\" I said, \"and thy will so in-Hims itself, blest spirit, that no wish can rob thee of itself.",
    "Therefore thy voice, which, with the song of those devoted fires, who with their six wings make themselves a cowl, is always charming Heaven, why gives it not contentment to my wishes? I, indeed, would not await thy asking me, if I in-thee'd myself as thou in-me'est thee.\"",

    "Folco that people called me, unto whom my name was known; and this heaven is by me impressed, as I was formerly by it; for Belus' daughter, when she troubled both Sichaeus and Creùsa, burned no more than I, as long as it beseemed my hair; nor did that Rhodopean maid, whose love Demòphoön deceived, nor yet Alcides, while in his heart he kept Iole locked.",

Though I on genius, practice and art should call, I could not so describe it, that it e'er could be imagined; but it can be believed, and sight of it should be desired! And for such heights if low be our imagination, is no wonder; for no eye ever reached beyond the sun.",

    "In one I heard beginning: \"Since the ray of Grace, whereby true love is set on fire, and afterward, by dint of loving, grows and multiplies, is shining in thee so, that it conducts thee upward o'er the stairs which none without remounting e'er descends; he who thy thirst the wine within his flask refused, would be no more at liberty, than water is which falls not to the sea.",

    "That father, then, and master went his way with both his Lady and that family, which now was girding on the humble cord; nor let base-heartedness weigh down his brow for being Peter Bernardòne's son, nor yet for seeming so contemptible to others; but revealed his stern resolve to Innocent with royal dignity, and won from him his Order's primal seal.",

    "When Him it pleased, who granted him such weal, to draw him up to that reward, which he, by making himself lowly, had deserved, to his own brethren, as to rightful heirs, he recommended his most precious Lady, and ordered them to love her faithfully; then from her bosom his illustrious soul willed to depart, and to its realm returned, and for its body wished no other bier.",
    "Think now what he was, who, as his companion, was worthy deemed to keep the bark of Peter true to its course, when sailing on the deep! That was our Patriarch; thou, hence, canst see that he who follows him as he commands, loadeth his vessel with good merchandise.",
    "And yet his flock, so greedy for new food hath grown, that it can hardly fail to scatter through various wood and mountain pasture lands; and hence, the more his sheep like vagabonds wander away, and further go from him, emptier of milk do they regain the fold.",
    "Yet surely some there are, who, dreading harm, cling to their shepherd; but so few are these, that little cloth will furnish them with cowls.",
    "If, now, my words have not been indistinct, and if thy hearing hath attentive been, and thou recall to mind what I have said, partly contented will thy wishes be; because thou 'lt see the plant whence hewn they are, and what the limitation means: ‘Whereon one thriveth well, if one go not astray.\"'",

    "As when, both parallel and like in hue, two rainbows o'er a tender cloud are drawn, when Juno issues orders to her maid, the outer being from the inner born, as is the speaking of that wandering nymph, whom love consumed as mists are by the sun; and cause folk here, by reason of the pact which God with Noah made, to prophesy about the world, that it will not again be flooded; so, of those eternal roses the two wreaths turned around us there, and so the outer with the inmost harmonized.",
    "After the dance and great high feast of song, and flaming interplay of light with light in joyful happiness and tender love, had of a sudden and with one accord grown quiet, even as eyes do, which must close and open at the will of what attracts them; out of the heart of one of those new lights a voice came forth, as to its ‘where' I turned, which made me seem a needle to its star.",

    "Christ's host, which cost so much to arm anew, was slowly, timidly, and small in numbers moving behind its Standard, when the Emperor who ever reigns, provided, of His Grace alone, for His endangered host, and not because of its deserts; and helped His Bride, as it hath here been said, with champions twain, through whom, because of what they did and said, the people who had strayed away returned.",

    "He truly seemed Christ's messenger and servant, because the first love which appeared in him, was for the primal counsel given by Christ.",
    "Often was he discovered by his nurse lying awake and silent on the ground, as if he meant thereby: ‘I came for this.' O Felix, of a truth, his father was! O truly Joan, his mother, if it mean what it is said to, when interpreted! Not for the world's sake, for which men now toil, following the man of Ostia, and Taddèo, but for the love of spirit-food, so great a teacher did he shortly make himself, that he began to go about the vineyard, which withers soon, if idle be the vintner; and of the Chair, which to the righteous poor was formerly more kind, not through its own, but through the fault of him who, sitting there, degenerates, he asked not for the right to give or two or three for six, nor yet the income of the earliest vacancy, nor even the tithes, which to God's poor belong; but leave to fight against the erring world for that seed's sake, whereof plants twenty-four are girding thee.",

    "And yet I say that one who, page by page, should search our book, would still some paper find, where he could read: ‘What I was wont to be, I am;' but from Casale he 'll not come, nor yet from Acquasparta, whence such men approach the rule, that one evades, and one contracts its scope.",

    "Of these the wax, and that which mouldeth it, are not of one same kind; hence, underneath the ideal stamp, they more or less reflect it; it hence results that, after its own kind, one selfsame plant bears better fruit and worse; and that with different natures ye are born.",
    "If tempered to perfection were the wax, and if the heavens were at their height of power, the whole light of the seal would be revealed;",

    "I have not spoken so, that thou shouldst not see clearly that a king he was, who asked wisdom to be a worthy king; and not to know the number of the Angels here; nor whether from a necessary premise, with one contingent, a necessity e'er followed as result; nor yet to know if a first motion needs must granted be, nor whether a triangle could be made, with no right angle, in a semicircle.",

    "Then round us everywhere, of equal brightness, outside the luster there, another rose, like an horizon which is growing clear; and as new apparitions come in sight throughout the sky, at early evening's rise, sò that one's vision seems, and seems not, true; meseemed that new subsistences I there began to see, and that a ring was forming outside the other two circumferences.",

    "Thou shalt find out how salt another's bread is wont to taste, and what a painful thing is going up and down another's stairs.",
    "But what will bow thy shoulders most will be the bad and foolish company, with whom thou 'lt fall into this vale; for all ungrateful, mad and malevolent will it become against thee; but soon thereafter, it, not thou, will have its forehead red with blood.",
    "Its deeds will furnish proof of its bestiality; hence well-becoming will it be for thee to have made thyself a party by thyself.",
    "Thy earliest refuge and first lodging-place shall be the courtesy of that great Lombard, who on the Ladder bears the holy Bird; and who will have for thee such kind regard, that 'tween you two, in doing and in asking, that will be first, which is with others last.",
    "With him the man thou 'lt see, who was, when born, so stamped by this strong star, that notable will be his deeds.",
    "By reason of his youth, the nations are not yet aware of him, for only nine years have these wheels revolved around him; but, before the Gascon cheat the noble Henry, sparks of his character will manifest themselves by disregard for money or for toil.",
    "And so well known will his munificence hereafter be, that ev'n his enemies will not be able to still their tongues at it.",
    "On him rely, and on his favors; many will be changed because of him, the rich and those that beg exchanging states; and written on thy mind shalt thou bear hence, but shalt not tell it,\" — here he told me things incredible to those who shall be present.",
    "Then he added: \"Son, glosses are these on what was said to thee; behold the snares which lie concealed behind not many circlings of the sun.",
    "And yet I would not have thee envious toward thy neighbors, because thy life far longer will extend than will the punishment of their bad faith.\"",
    "When by his silence that blest soul had showed that he was through with weaving in the woof of that same web which I had given him warped,",
    "then I began, like one who, doubting, longs for counsel from a man who both perceives, wills righteously and loves: \"I clearly see, my father, how toward me a time spurs on, to deal me such a blow as heaviest is to him who gives least heed to it; 't is, therefore, well that I should so with foresight arm myself, that if the place which is to me most dear be taken from me, I lose not the rest by these my verses.",
    "Downward through the world whose bitterness is endless, and around the Mount, from whose fair top my Lady's eyes have lifted me, and afterward through Heaven from light to light, things have I heard which, if repeated, will for many have the taste of bitter herbs; and yet, if I 'm to truth a timid friend, I fear lest life I lose with those who shall of this age speak as ancient.\"",
    "The light, wherein that treasure smiled, which there I found, sparkled at first, as in a sunbeam a golden mirror would; and then replied: \"A conscience gloomy either with its own, or with another's shame, will feel, indeed, the harshness of thy words; yet, none the less, all falsehood having been removed from it, cause thy whole vision to be manifest, and where the itch is let the scratching be!",
    "For if, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove offensive, it will after leave behind it, when once digested, vital nourishment.",
    "This cry of thine will do as doth the wind, which strikes the loftiest summits most; and this will no slight honor prove.",
    "Hence only souls well known to fame were shown thee in these Heavens, upon the Mount, and in the woeful Vale; because the mind of him who hears rests not, nor strengthens its belief by illustrations based upon what is hidden and unknown, or by an argument that is not clear.\"",
    "That blessèd mirror was enjoying now its thoughts alone, and I was tasting mine, tempering their sweetness with their bitterness; when that same Lady who was leading me to God, said: \"Change thy thought; recall that near I am to Who unburdens every wrong.\"",
    "I turned me at my Comfort's loving voice; and in her holy eyes what kind of love I then beheld, I here refrain from saying; not only since mine own words I distrust, but since my mind can not return so far above itself, unless Another guide it.",
    "This only of that moment can I tell, that my affection, while I gazed at her, was freed from longing for all other things, as long as Joy Eternal, which directly shone on Beatrice, with its reflected aspect was from her lovely face contenting me.",
    "Conquering me with the splendor of a smile, she said: \"Turn round and hark; for Paradise is not exclusively within my eyes.\"",
    "As our affection here is seen at times upon our countenance, if such it be that our whole spirit is thereby absorbed; so, in the flaming of the blest effulgence to whom I turned, I recognized his wish to have a little further talk with me.",
    "\"In this fifth threshold of the Tree,\" it then began, \"which from its summit draws its life, always bears fruit, and never loses leaves, are blessèd spirits, who, before they came to Heaven, enjoyed so great a fame below, that every Muse would be thereby enriched.",
    "Gaze, therefore, at the Cross's arms; and he, whom I shall name, will there perform the act, which in a cloud its own swift fire performs.\"",
    "I saw a splendor drawn along the Cross at Joshua's name, the moment it was uttered, nor did I note the name before the deed.",
    "And at great Maccabaeus' name, I saw another spirit whirling as he moved; and gladness was the whip that turned the top.",
    "Likewise, at Charlemagne's and Roland's names, my gaze intently followed two of them, as doth a falconer's eye his flying bird.",
    "Then William afterward, and Renoart, Duke Godfrey next, and Robert Guiscard drew my sight along that Cross.",
    "And then, moving and mingling with the other lights, the soul which had addressed me, showed how great an artist 'mong Heaven's choristers he was.",
    "Round to my right I turned me to behold in Beatrice my duty, signified by speech or act; and I beheld her eyes so joyous and so clear, that what she seemed surpassed her other and her latest wont.",
    "And as, because of feeling more delight in doing good, a man from day to day perceiveth that his virtue is increasing; ev'n so, on seeing that that miracle was fairer now, I noticed that the arc of my revolving with the heavens had grown.",
    "And as within a little space of time a lady turneth white, whene'er her face rids itself of the burden of its shame; such to mine eyes the change, when I had turned, through the white color of the temperate sixth star, which had received me in itself.",
    "I saw within that Jovial torch of light the sparkling of the love contained in it, shaping our language forth before mine eyes; and even as birds on rising from the shore, as if in gratulation at the food they've found, form groups, now round, and now of other shapes;",
    "thus holy creatures in those lights were singing, as here and there they flew, and with their forms made of themselves now D, now I, now L.",
    "Each singing to its note, they moved at first; then, on becoming one of these same letters, they stopped a little while, and silent kept.",
    "O thou divine Pegàsean Muse, that glorious dost make men's genius, and dost render it long-lived, as it through thee doth towns and realms, so shed thy light on me, that I may here describe their figures ev'n as I perceived them; in these brief verses let thy power appear!",
    "They then displayed themselves in consonants and vowels five times seven; and as their parts seemed to be said to me, I noted them.",
    "Diligite Justitiam were first verb and noun of all that was depicted there; Qui Judicatis Terram were the last.",
    "Then in the fifth word's M they so remained arranged, that Jupiter seemed silver there pricked out with gold.",
    "And other lights I saw descend upon the summit of the M, and rest there, singing, I believe, the Good which draws them to Itself.",
    "Then, as when logs are struck while burning, endless sparks fly up, whence fools are wont to draw their auguries;",
    "more than a thousand lights appeared to rise, and upward move, some much, and some a little, even as the Sun, which setteth them on fire, allotted them; and when they quiet were, each in its place, an Eagle's head and neck I saw portrayed by that outstanding fire.",
    "He who paints there hath none to be His guide, but is His own guide; and from Him derives the instinct which is formative in nests.",
    "The other blest ones, who at first appeared content to form a Lily on the M, went slowly on to shape the Eagle's form.",
    "O gentle star, what and how many gems proved to me that our justice here results from that heaven's influence which is gemmed by thee! I therefore pray the Mind, wherein thy motion and virtue start, that It may so regard the source, whence comes the smoke which spoils thy rays, that It may now a second time be wroth with sale and purchase in that temple's court, whose walls were built with blood and martyrdom.",
    "O soldiers of the heaven I contemplate, pray ye for those that are on earth, all gone astray behind the bad example there! War was once carried on with swords; but now by taking here and there that bread away, the Pitying Father keepeth locked from none.",
    "But thou, that writest but to cancel, think that Peter and Paul, who for that vineyard died, which thou art laying waste, are still alive! Well mayst thou say: \"So set is my desire on him, whose will it was to live alone, and for a dance was led to martyrdom, that I know neither Fisherman nor Paul.\"",
    "Before me now, with wings outspread, appeared the lovely image, which in sweet fruition those joyous interwoven spirits made.",
    "Each one of them a little ruby seemed, wherein a ray of sunlight burned so brightly, that it was mirrored back into mine eyes.",
    "And what I now must needs relate, no voice hath e'er reported, nor hath ink inscribed, nor hath imagination ever grasped; for I both saw and heard the beak converse, and utter in its voice both ‘I' and ‘My,' when in its meaning it was ‘We' and Our.'",
    "And it began: \"Because of being just and merciful, I'm to a glory raised up here, which doth not let itself be won by mere desire; and such a fame I left on earth, that evil people there commend it, but fail to follow its recorded works.\"",
    "As out of many embers one sole heat makes itself felt, so from that image, formed by many loves, a single voice came forth.",
    "Hence I thereafter: \"O perpetual flowers of joy eternal, who let all your odors seem only one to me, by breathing, break the painful fast, which long hath given me hunger, for I on earth have found no food for it.",
    "Well do I know that, even if in Heaven Justice Divine makes of another realm its looking-glass, yours apprehends it not through any veil.",
    "Ye know with what attention I gird myself to listen; and ye know the doubt which is so old a fast for me.\"",
    "And as a falcon, from his hood set free, tosses his head, and, flapping his proud wings, displays his eagerness, and plumes himself; such I beheld the symbol which is weaved by praises of the Grace Divine, become with songs, which who up there rejoices knows.",
    "It then began: \"He who His compass turned around the world's last verge, and in it parted its many hidden things from those revealed, was not so able to impress His Virtue on all the world, that His conceived ideal should not remain in infinite excess.",
    "And this assures one that the first proud being who greater was than all created spirits, through not awaiting light, untimely fell;",
    "it hence results that every lesser nature is but a scant recipient for the Good which hath no end, and measures Self by Self.",
    "Your vision, therefore, which must needs be one of that Mind's rays, wherewith all things are filled, of its own nature cannot be so strong, that it should not perceive its Source as being far greater than is all that it can see.",
    "The vision, therefore, which your world receives, into Eternal Justice penetrates as doth an eye into the sea; because, though it perceive its bottom near the shore, when on the deep it sees it not; yet there it is, but its great depth conceals it.",
    "That is not light, which comes not from the Sky which never clouds itself; but rather darkness, a shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.",
    "Sufficiently disclosed to thee is now the hiding-place which once concealed from thee the Living Justice, which so frequently it was thy wont to question; for thou saidst: ‘A man is born upon the Indus' banks, with no one there to speak of Christ, or read, or write; and all his actions and desires are good, as far as human reason sees, and without sin in either life or speech;",
    "then, unbaptized and without faith, he dies.",
    "Wherein consists the Justice which condemns him? Where is his fault, if he believeth not?'",
    "Now who art thou, that as a judge would'st sit to judge of things a thousand miles away with the short vision of a human span? Surely for him who subtly strives with me, were not the Scriptures ruling over you, wondrous occasions would there be for doubt.",
    "O earthly creatures! O uncultured minds!",
    "The Primal Will, which of Itself is Good, ne'er from Itself, the Highest Goodness, moved.",
    "That much is just, which is therewith accordant; no good created draws It to itself, but It by radiating causes it.\"",
    "As o'er her nest a stork moves circling round, after the feeding of her little ones, and as the one that 's fed looks up at her; such did the blessèd shape become, which moved its pinions, by so many counsels urged, and, likewise, so did I lift up my brows.",
    "Wheeling around, it sang and said: \"As now my notes to thee, that understand'st them not, such to you mortals is Eternal Justice.\"",
    "When those bright flamings of the Holy Spirit had come to rest, still in the shape which caused the Romans to be honored by the world,",
    "\"None to this Kingdom\" it began again, \"ever ascended without faith in Christ, either before, or after He was nailed upon the tree.",
    "But many, lo! shout ‘Christ!' who at the Judgment shall be far less near Him, than will be such an one who knows not Christ; Christians like these the Ethiop will condemn, when parted shall the two assemblies be, one rich eternally, the other poor.",
    "What will the Persians to your rulers say, when lying open they shall see the Book, wherein all their dispraises are inscribed?",
    "There will be seen, among the deeds of Albert, that which ere long will move the pen, because thereby Prague's kingdom will become a waste.",
    "There will be seen the woe, which on the Seine he who shall perish by a boar skin's blow, bringeth about by falsifying coin.",
    "There will be seen the pride and thirsty greed, which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad, that neither can remain within his bounds.",
    "One will see there the easy life and lust of him of Spain, and of Bohemia, too, who neither of them knew, nor cared for, valor.",
    "One will see there, marked with a single I, the virtues of Jerusalem's lame king, whereas an M will mark the contrary.",
    "One will see there the greed and cowardice of him who ruleth o'er the isle of fire, where once Anchises ended his long life.",
    "And, to explain his insignificance, his record will consist of shortened words, which in a little space will notice much.",
    "And there to each and all will be revealed the foul deeds of his uncle and his brother, who two crowns and a noble line disgraced.",
    "And he of Portugal, and he of Norway, will there be known, as also Rascia's prince, who in an ill hour saw Venetia's coin.",
    "O happy Hungary, if she no more shall let herself be wronged! Happy Navarre, if with her girding hills she arm herself! And both these should believe that Nicosaa and Famagosta, as a proof of this, are wailing now, and raging at their beast, because he does not differ from the rest.\"",
    "When he who sheddeth light on all the world so far below our hemisphere descends, that daylight fades away on every side, the sky, once lighted up by him alone, is quickly rendered visible again by many lights, whereof one only shines; and I this happening in the sky recalled, when silent in the blessèd beak became the Standard of the world and of its leaders; for, brighter far, those living lights commenced songs which have fled and fallen from my mind.",
    "O thou sweet Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee, how ardent in those flutes didst thou appear, whose only breath was that of holy thoughts!",
    "After those precious and pellucid jewels wherewith I saw the sixth great light engemmed, had brought to silence their angelic chimes, I seemed to hear the murmur of a brook, which, flowing limpid down from rock to rock, reveals the abundance of its mountain-springs.",
    "And as a sound takes from a cittern's neck its form, even as the air that enters it doth from the vent-hole of a shepherd's pipe, so, all delay of waiting laid aside, that murmur of the Eagle mounted up along its neck, as if it hollow were.",
    "A voice it there became, and through its beak it issued forth in words, such as the heart whereon I wrote them down, was longing for.",
    "\"That part of me which sees, and braves the sun, in mortal eagles,\" it began again, \"must now be looked upon attentively, for of the fires wherewith I shape me, those wherewith the eye is sparkling in my head, the highest are of all their ordered grades.",
    "He that as pupil in the middle shines, was once the singer of the Holy Spirit, who bore the Ark about from town to town; he now knows how deserving was his song, so far as it resulted from his will, by the reward proportioned to its merit.",
    "Of five that make a circle for my brow, the spirit nearest to my beak was he, who comforted the widow for her son; he now knows by his personal experience of this sweet life and of its opposite, how dear it costs one not to follow Christ.",
    "In the circumference of which I speak, he that comes next upon the rising arc, delayed his death by genuine repentance; he now knows that Eternal Justice brooks no change, whenever worthy prayers below to-morrow's make of that which was today's.",
    "The one who follows, with the laws and me, with good intentions which produced bad fruits, made himself Greek by ceding to the Shepherd; he now knows that the ill, from his good deed derived, is not a cause of harm to him, although thereby the world may be destroyed.",
    "He whom thou seest in the downward arc, the William was, for whom that country mourns, which weeps because its Charles and Frederick live; he now knows how Heaven loves a righteous king, and by his splendor's glow reveals it still.",
    "Who in the erring world below would think that Rapheus the Trojan was the fifth among the holy lights which form this curve? He now knows many of the things the world is impotent to see in Grace Divine, although his sight discerneth not its depths.",
    "Like a young lark which, as it soars through space, first sings, and then is silent, satisfied with the last sweetness which contented her;",
    "such seemed to me the image of the seal of that Eternal Pleasure, by whose will each thing becometh what it is.",
    "And though, with reference to my doubt, up there I was, as glass is to the color which it clothes, it could not bear to bide its time in silence; but by the very force of its own weight urged from my mouth the words, \"What things are these?\" whereat I saw a glorious feast of sparkling.",
    "Thereafter, with its eye the more enkindled, the blessèd Sign, in order not to keep me in wondering suspense, replied to me: \"I see that thou believest all these things, because I say them, but dost not see how; and therefore, though believed in, they are hidden.",
    "Thou dost as one who fully knows a thing by name, but cannot see just what it is, unless another make it manifest.",
    "Regnum Coelorum suffers violence from burning love, and from a living hope, which vanquishes the Will Divine; though not as man o'ercometh man, but conquers it because it willeth to be overcome; and so, though vanquished, by its goodness wins.",
    "The first life in the eyebrow, and the fifth cause thee to be amazed, because therewith thou see'st the region of the Angels painted.",
    "They did not issue Gentiles from their bodies, as thou dost think, but Christians, with firm faith, one in the Feet that were to suffer, one, in those that had.",
    "For one, to claim his bones, came back from Hell, where no one ever wills the good again; and this was the reward of living hope; of living hope which put its trust in prayers addressed to God to raise him, that thus his will might have a chance to act.",
    "The glorious soul I speak of, when the flesh had been regained, wherein he stayed not long, believed in Him, who had the power to help him; and through belief so warmed to genuine love, that he was worthy at his second death to come to this festivity.",
    "The other, through grace from so profound a spring distilled, that never hath the eye of any creature reached its first wave, set all his love below on righteousness; hence God, from grace to grace, to our redemption which is still to be, opened his eyes; he hence believed in it, and afterward endured no more the stench of Paganism; and for it he rebuked those who perverted were.",
    "And those three Ladies thou sawest at the right wheel of the Car, in lieu of baptism, were as sponsors for him more than a thousand years ere baptism was.",
    "O thou Predestination, how remote are thy foundations from the sight of those who do not see the First Cause as a whole!",
    "And ye, O mortals, keep yourselves in check, when judging men; for we, who God behold, know not as yet all those that are elect; and pleasant is such ignorance to us, because our good is in this good refined, that what is willed by God, we also will.\"",
    "Thus, then, by that divinely pictured image, to make the shortness of my vision clear, a pleasant medicine was granted me.",
    "And as a skillful cithern player makes the string's vibrations follow a good singer, whereby the song acquires more power to please; even so, while it was speaking, I recall that both those blessèd lights I then beheld, as when, in winking, eyes concordant are, moving their flamelets to the Eagle's words.",
    "And now mine eyes upon my Lady's face were fixed again, and therewithal my mind, which from all other objects had withdrawn.",
    "Nor was she smiling then; but: \"Should I smile,\" she said, addressing me, \"like Sèmelë wouldst thou become, when she to ashes turned; because my beauty, which along the stairs of this eternal palace brighter burns, as thou hast seen, the higher we ascend, is so resplendent that thy mortal strength at its effulgence, were it not restrained, would be as is a bough which lightning rends.",
    "Up to the seventh splendor we are raised, which now beneath the burning Lion's breast is raying downward mingled with his strength.",
    "Intently fix thy mind behind thine eyes, and cause them to be mirrors of the figure which in this mirror will appear to thee.\"",
    "He that should know what, in the blessèd face, the nature of my vision's pasture was, when I transferred me to another care,",
    "would know, since one was outweighed by the other, how gladly I obeyed my heavenly Guide.",
    "Within the crystal which, as round the world it whirls, bears its illustrious leader's name, under whose rule all wickedness lay dead, colored like gold whereon a sun-beam shone, a Ladder I beheld, which so high up ascended, that my eye pursued it not.",
    "I saw, moreover, coming down its steps so many glowing splendors, that I thought that every star seen shining in the sky had been poured out of it.",
    "And even as daws, as is their natural wont, when day begins, together move to warm their chilly plumes; and then without returning some fly off, and some go back to whence they started first, while others, whirling in a circle, stay; such was, it seemed to me, the fashion here within the sparkling throng which came together, whene'er they met upon a certain round; and that which nearest to me there remained, became so bright, that in my thoughts I said: \"I clearly see the love thou showest me.\"",
    "But she, whence I await the how and when of silence and of speech, keeps still; hence I, against my will, do well by asking naught.",
    "She, thereupon, who in the sight of Him who seeth everything, my silence saw, said unto me: \"Appease thy warm desire!\"",
    "And I began: \"My merit doth not make me worthy of thy reply; but, for the sake of her who granteth me the right to ask, make known to me, blest life that art concealed in thine own joy, the cause which draweth thee so closely to my side; and tell me why that gentle symphony of Paradise is silent in this wheel, which down below sounds so devoutly through the other spheres.\"",
    "\"Thy hearing is as mortal as thy sight;\" it answered me; \"there is no singing here because of that which hinders Beatrice from smiling.",
    "Down the holy Ladder's steps have I so far descended, but to give thee a welcome with my words and with the light which mantles me; nor hath a greater love caused me to be more ready; for as much or more love burns up yonder, as those flames reveal to thee; but that great charity which makes us ready servants of the Counsel which rules the world, allots here, as thou seest.\"",
    "\"I well perceive, O holy lamp,\" said I, \"hòw that free love is in this court enough for following the Eternal Providence;",
    "but this is what seems hard for me to see, why thou alone among thy consorts here predestinated wert for just this task.\"",
    "No sooner had I come to my last word, than, like a rapid millstone whirling round, the light had of its middle made its center; and then the love within it answered me:",
    "\"Piercing the light wherein I'm here embosomed, a ray of light divine upon me falls, whose virtue, as it mingles with my sight, so lifts me o'er myself, that I behold that Highest Essence whence it emanates.",
    "Hence comes the joy with which I'm flaming now, for with my sight, as far as it is clear, I equalize the clearness of my flame.",
    "And yet the most enlightened soul in Heaven, the Seraph who hath eyes most fixed on God, would not avail to satisfy thy question; for what thou askest plumbeth so the depths of God's eternal statute, that from all created vision it is cut away.",
    "And to the mortal world, on thy return, carry this charge, that it presume no more to move its feet toward such a distant goal.",
    "The mind which shineth here, on earth is smoky; consider, hence, how it can do down there what, though assumed to Heaven, it cannot do.\"",
    "So all-conclusive were his words to me, that, giving up the question, I confined me to asking humbly of him who he was.",
    "\"'Tween Italy's two seashores cliffs arise, not very far from thine own native place, so high, that thunders peal much lower down; and form a lofty ridge called Càtria, 'neath which a hermitage is consecrate, whose wont to worship only gives it up.\"",
    "He thus began for me his third address, and then, continuing, said: \"To serving God I there became so steadfastly devoted, that, feeding upon olive juice alone, I readily endured both heat and cold, and was with thoughts contemplative content.",
    "That cloister's wont it was to yield these heavens abundant fruit; but it hath now become so empty, that its state must soon be known.",
    "In that place I was known as Peter Damian; and Sinning Peter in Our Lady's House I was, upon the Adriatic shore.",

    "They cover so their palfreys with their cloaks, that two beasts walk beneath a single hide.",
    "O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!\"",
    "More flamelets at these words I saw descend from step to step, and whirl; and every whirl caused each of them to grow more beautiful; and round this flame they came, and having stopped, uttered so deep a cry, that none could here resemble it; nor did I understand its words; its thunder overcame me so.",
    "Oppressed with stupor, to my Guide I turned, as would a little child who always runs for help to where he most confides; and she, as doth a mother who at once assists her pale and breathless offspring with her voice, whose wont is to assure him, said to me:",
    "\"Knowest thou not that thou art now in Heaven? and know'st thou not that all of Heaven is holy, and that of good zeal cometh all done here? To what extent the song, as well as I by smiling, would have changed thee, thou canst now imagine, since the cry has shocked thee so; in it, if thou hadst understood its prayers, already were that vengeance known to thee, which thou shalt see before thou die.",
    "Our sword up here cuts nor in haste nor tardily, save as to one it seems, who waits for it with either apprehension or desire.",
    "But turn thyself around toward others now; for many illustrious spirits shalt thou see, if, as I tell thee, thou direct thine eyes.",
    "Mine eyes I then directed as she pleased, and saw a hundred little spheres which, gathering, by mutual rays each other fairer made.",
    "Like one I was, who checks within himself the goad of his desire, and dares not ask, so great his fear lest he may ask too much.",
    "The largest and most lustrous of those pearls came forward thereupon, to sate my wish concerning it.",
    "Within it then I heard: \"If thou, as I do, couldst behold the love which burns among us here, thy thoughts would be expressed; but lest, by waiting, thou delay thy lofty aim, I'll answer now the thought which causes thee to so restrain thyself.",

    "Then \"Brother,\" he replied, \"thy great desire in the last sphere above shall be fulfilled, where all thine others are, and mine as well.",
    "Every desire is perfect there, mature and whole; in that sphere only is each part where it has always been; for it is not in space, nor turns on poles, and up to it our Ladder reaches; and because of this it steals itself away beyond thy ken.",

    "But from the earth, to climb it, no one now removes his feet, and my monastic rule remains but as a means of wasting paper.",
    "Walls which of old an abbey used to be, have now become the dens of thieves, and cowls are sacks now, filled with naught but wretched meal.",
    "But heavy usury doth not rebel against God's will, as much as doth the fruit which renders so insane the hearts of monks; for, whatsoe'er the Church may hold in trust, is all for those that ask it in God's name, and not for relatives, or what is worse.",
    "So soft the flesh of mortals is, that good beginnings do not last as long below, as from an oak's until its acorn's birth.",
    "Peter began with neither gold nor silver, and I, with prayers and fasts began my convent, as Francis, with humility, did his.",
    "And if thou look at each of these beginnings, and then consider whither each hath run, thou 'lt see that what was white hath turned to brown.",
    "Jordan turned backward, and the water fleeing when God so willed, were much more wonderful to see, in fact, than succor would be here.\"",
    "He thus addressed me; to his company thereat returning, they together closed; then, like a whirlwind, all were upward rapt.",
    "The gentle Lady up that Ladder's rounds urged me behind them by a sign alone, her virtue so o'ercame my natural weight;",
    "nor here below, where one goes up and down by natural law, was motion e'er so swift, as to be equal to my pinions' flight.",
    "So may I, Reader, once again return to that celestial triumph, for whose sake I oft bewail my sins and smite my breast; thou hadst not drawn away and put thy finger as quickly into fire, as I beheld the sign which follows Taurus, and was in it.",
    "O glorious stars, O light, that pregnant art with mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge all of my genius, whatsoe'er it be; with you was born, and in your midst was hiding he who is father of all mortal life, when first I breathed the Tuscan air; and then, when grace had been bestowed upon me here to enter that high wheel which turns you round, your region was the one allotted me.",
    "To you my sighing soul devoutly prays, that it may now acquire the power it needs for that hard task, which draws her to itself.\"",
    "\"To Ultimate Salvation thou art now so near,\" in answer Beatrice began, \"that clear should be thine eyes, and keen their sight.",
    "Therefore, ere further thou in-it thyself, look downward, and behold how great a world I have already set beneath thy feet;",
    "so that thy heart, as joyous as it can, may show itself to that triumphant throng which happy comes through this ethereal sphere.\"",
    "Then with my vision I returned through one and all seven spheres, and this globe I beheld such that its mean appearance made me smile; hence that opinion I approve as best which deems it least; and just may he be called, who sets his thought on something else.",
    "Latona's daughter I enkindled saw without the shadow which was once the cause of my believing her both rare and dense.",
    "The countenance, Hyperion, of thy son I here sustained; and saw how near to him both Maia and Diòne round him move.",
    "And after this, the temperance of Jove appeared to me, between his son and sire; and clear the reason for their change of place.",
    "All seven of them were thus revealed to me, how great they are, how swift, and far apart in their abodes.",
    "The little threshing-floor which maketh us so fierce, was as a whole revealed to me, from hills to river-mouths, while I was circling with the eternal Twins.",
    "Back to the lovely eyes I then turned mine.",
    "Even as a bird, among the leaves she loves, settles upon the nest of her sweet brood throughout the night, which hides things from our eyes, and then — that she may see their longed for looks, and find the food wherewith to nourish them, in doing which she deems hard work a pleasure — comes forth betimes upon an outer branch, and gazing steadfastly with burning love, waits for the sun till break of dawn; so stood my Lady, toward that region turned intent, 'neath which the sun appears to show least haste; hence I, on seeing her absorbed in thought, became like one who, yearning with desire for other things, contents himself with hope.",
    "But little time elapsed between each ‘when,' I mean from when I waited, till the sky I saw grow more and more suffused with light.",
    "Then Beatrice exclaimed: \"Behold the hosts of Christ's victorious triumph, and all the fruit ingathered by the circling of these spheres!\"",
    "To me her countenance seemed all on fire, and so replete with happiness her eyes, that I must pass without describing them.",
    "As, when in cloudless skies the moon is full, Travia among those nymphs eternal smiles, who deck with light the whole expanse of heaven; so I, above a thousand thousand lamps, beheld a Sun which kindled one and all, as our sun kindles all the stars on high; and through the living light the Shining Substance was so transparent, and so brightly shone upon my face, that I endured it not.",
    "O Beatrice, thou dear and gentle Guide! \"That which o'erwhelms thee is a Power,\" she said, \"against which nothing can defend itself.",
    "This is the Wisdom, this the Virtue is, which opened wide the road 'tween Heaven and earth, which was in olden times so long desired.\"",
    "As fire is liberated from a cloud, when so dilating that it finds no room, and falls, against its nature, to the earth; even so my mind, as it became enlarged among those viands, issued from itself; but what it then became, can not recall.",
    "\"Open thine eyes, and see what now I am! Such things hast thou perceived, that thou art now equipped with power to look upon my smile.\"",
    "I was like one who, when aroused from sleep, is of a dream aware which he forgets, and tries in vain to bring it back to mind, when I had heard a bidding which deserves such gratitude, that never from the book which holds past records will it be effaced.",
    "If now, to help me, all those tongues should speak, which Polyhymnia and her sisters fed most richly with the sweetest of their milk, the thousandth portion of the truth would not be reached, ev'n though they sang the holy smile, and how it lighted up the holy face; hence, painting Paradise, the sacred Poem must leap like one who finds his path cut off.",
    "But none, who to its weighty theme gave thought, and to the mortal shoulder bearing it, would blame it, should it tremble 'neath its load.",
    "No waters for a little boat are these, my daring plow goes cleaving on its way, nor for a pilot who would spare himself.",
    "\"Why doth my countenance enamor thee so much, that to the garden beautiful thou turnest not, which blooms beneath Christ's rays? Here is the Rose, in which the Word Divine became incarnate; here the Lilies are, whose scent led men to take the righteous path.\"",
    "Thus Beatrice; and I, who for her counsels was wholly ready, gave myself again to fight the battle of the feeble brows.",
    "As once my overshadowed eyes beheld a field of flowers in a ray of sunlight which through a riven cloud was shining clear; thus many a throng of splendors saw I now, illumined from on high by burning rays, but not the source of their refulgent light.",
    "O Kindly Virtue, who dost thus impress them, thou didst uplift thyself, to give mine eyes, which were not strong yet, greater room to see.",
    "The name of that fair Flower which I invoke each morn and evening, too, forced all my mind to turn its gaze upon the greatest fire; but when in both mine eyes the magnitude and splendor of that living Star was painted, which vanquishes up there, as once down here; a torch, formed ring-wise like a crown, descended from midmost heaven, and girdling her about, around her whirled.",
    "Whatever melody sounds sweetest here on earth, and to itself most strongly draws the soul, would seem a peal of thunder breaking from a cloud, if measured by the music of the lyre, with which that lovely Sapphire crowned itself, whereby ensapphired glows the brightest heaven.",
    "\"Angelic Love am I, and circle round the exalted gladness breathing from the womb which was the hostelry of our Desire; and I shall whirl around it, Lady of Heaven, until thy Son thou follow, and diviner render the loftiest sphere by entering it.\"",
    "The circling melody thus closed itself as with a seal; and all the other lights made Mary's name resound.",
    "The royal robe of all the convolutions of the world, which burneth most, and by the breath and ways of God is quickened with the greatest life, had its internal shore so far above us, that, where I was, its semblance was not yet revealed to me; mine eyes, hence, could not follow the Flame which, crowned, behind its Offspring rose.",
    "And as a child, who, having had its milk, stretches its little arms up toward its mother, urged by the love which outwardly flames forth; thus each of those white spirits with its flame stretched up in such a way, that its deep love for Mary was made manifest to me.",
    "Thereafter they remained there in my presence, singing O Queen of Heaven' so tenderly that its delight hath never left me since.",
    "Oh, how abundant is the store heaped up in those most wealthy coffers, which were once good husbandmen for sowing seed below! Here, living on it, they enjoy the treasure, which, weeping in their exile, they acquired in Babylon, where gold was left untouched.",
    "Here triumphs, subject to the Exalted Son of God and Mary, in His victory, together with the councils old and new, he who of such great glory holds the Keys.",
    "\"O Fellowship elected to the banquet of that Blest Lamb, who feedeth you so well, that ever sated is your appetite; since, by the grace of God, this man enjoys a foretaste of what falleth from your table, or ever death have set his time for him, heed his immense desire, and on him shed a little of your dew! Ye from the Source forever drink, whence cometh what he thinks.\"",
    "Thus Beatrice; thereat those happy spirits arranged themselves in spheres on steady poles, emitting brilliant flames, as comets do.",
    "And ev'n as wheels within the works of clocks so turn, for one who heeds them, that the first seems quiet, while the last appears to fly; even so, since at a different speed they whirled, those carol-dances, whether swift or slow, permitted me to estimate their wealth.",
    "From that one which I deemed of greatest beauty, I saw a fire so happy issue forth, that none it left of greater brightness there;",
    "then around Beatrice it turned three times with so divine a song, that even my fancy repeats it not for me; and so my pen takes a leap forward, and I write it not; for our imagination, much more speech, too bright a color is to paint such folds.",
    "\"O holy sister mine, who so devoutly dost pray to us, thou, by thine ardent love, withdrawest me from yonder lovely sphere.\" When once at rest again, that blessèd fire turned toward my Lady with his voice, which spoke as I have said.",
    "And she replied to him:\"O thou eternal life of that great man, to whom of this great joy our Lord bequeathed the Keys which He brought down; test thou this man as pleases thee, on questions light and grave pertaining to the Faith, which formerly enabled thee to walk upon the sea.",
    "If well he love, well hope, and well believe, is not concealed from thee, because thy sight is thither turned where all is seen depicted; but since this Realm hath through the true Faith won its citizens, 't is well that, to its glory, it should befall him now to speak of it.\"",
    "Even as a bachelor equips himself — nor speaks, until the master states the question — to furnish proofs, but not decide the same;",
    "so I, while she was speaking, armed myself, with every proof, that I might ready be for such a questioner, and such confession.",
    "\"Speak now, good Christian, and declare thyself; What, then, is Faith?\" Thereat I raised my brow toward the bright light from which these words were breathed; and then I turned around toward Beatrice, and she by rapid signals bade me pour the water forth from my internal fount.",
    "\"The Grace which grants that I confess myself before the first Centurion,\" I began, \"cause my conceptions to be well expressed.\" And I continued: \"As the truthful pen of thy dear brother, Father, who with thee set Rome upon the right way, wrote of it, Faith is the substance of the hoped for things, and the evidence of those that are not seen; this seems to me its essence.\" Then I heard:",
    "\"Thou thinkest right, if well thou understand why with the substances he placed it first, and with the evidences afterward.\"",
    "Thereat I answered: \"Those deep truths which here are freely making themselves known to me, from eyes down yonder are so far concealed, that their existence lies in Faith alone, and thereupon the lofty Hope is based; it, therefore, takes the nature of a substance;",
    "and from this Faith one needs must syllogize without the help of any other sight; it, therefore, assumes the nature of an evidence.\"",
    "And then I heard: \"If thus were understood all that for doctrine is acquired below, there 'd be no room there for the sophist's mind.\"",
    "These words were breathed from that enkindled love, which added then: \"Already have this coin's alloy and weight been very well examined; but tell me if thou hast it in thy purse.\"",
    "I, therefore: \"Yes, so shining and so round, that nothing in its coinage makes me doubt.\"",
    "Then issued from the deep light shining there: \"Whence did this precious jewel come to thee, whereon all virtues else are based?\" And I:",
    "\"The abundant showers of the Holy Spirit, outpoured upon the parchments old and new, a syllogism have formed, which prove it true so clearly to me, that, all other proofs seem inconclusive when compared with it.",
    "\"The Ancient Premise and the New,\" I then heard asked, \"which so conclusive are to thee, why dost thou take them for the word of God?\"",
    "And I: \"The proof which showeth me the truth, are those great works which followed, works for which Nature ne'er heated iron, nor anvil smote.\"",
    "Then I was answered: \"Say what makes thee sure that those works e'er occurred? The very thing which calls for proof, none other, tells thee so.\"",
    "\"If to Christianity the world was turned,\" I said, \"unhelped by miracles, then this is such, that not a hundredth are the rest; for thou didst poor and fasting go afield, to sow the goodly plant, which was of old a vine, and now has turned into a thorn.\"",
    "This ending thus, the high and holy Court resounded through the spheres a \"God we praise!\" sung to the melody they sing up there.",
    "That Baron then, who thus from branch to branch had tested me, and now had led me on, until the final leaves were drawing near, began again: \"The Grace which with thy mind holds loving converse, hitherto hath oped thy mouth as it should be; hence I approve of that which it hath uttered; but it now behooves thee say what thou believest in, and whence it has been offered to thy faith.\"",
    "\"O holy father, spirit that dost now behold what thou didst so believe, that thou didst outrun toward the tomb far younger feet,\" I thus began, \"thou 'dst have me now reveal the essential part of my sincere belief, and thou dost also ask the cause of it.",
    "And I reply: In One God I believe, Sole and Eternal, who, Himself unmoved, moves all the heavens with Love and with Desire; and I, for so believing, have not only proofs physical and metaphysical, but that truth also yieldeth me its proof, which hence rains down through Moses, psalms and prophets, and through the Gospel, and through you, who wrote after the Flaming Spirit made you shepherds.",
    "And I believe in three Eternal Persons, and these to be one Essence, so both one and trine, that they can be conjoined by are and is.",
    "Of the divine profound estate whereto I now refer, the teaching of the Gospel sets many times the seal upon my mind.",
    "This is the fountain-head, and this the spark, which after spreads into a living flame, and in me glows, as stars do in the sky.\"",
    "As when a lord, hearing what pleases him, rejoices in the news his servant brings, and takes him to his arms, when he is silent; so, giving me his blessing as he sang, that Apostolic light, at whose command I spoke, when I had ceased, thrice girdled me; so greatly had I pleased him by my words.",
    "If e'er it happen that the Sacred Poem, to which both Heaven and earth have so set hand, that it hath made me lean for many years, o'ercome the fierceness which against me bars the lovely fold, where as a lamb I slept, though hostile to the wolves that give it war; then, with another voice and other fleece a Poet I'll return, and at the font of mine own baptism take the laurel crown; for there I entered first into the Faith, which makes souls known to God, and Peter later, because of my belief, thus wreathed my brow.",
    "Then toward us, after this, there moved a light out of the sphere, from which the first-fruit issued, which of his vicars Christ once left behind; and, full of joy, my Lady said to me: \"Look, look! Behold the Baron, for whose sake men go to see Galicia down on earth!\"",
    "As, when a dove alighteth near its mate, each, by its circling and its cooing, shows the other its affection; thus I saw",
    "one great and glorious Prince the other greet, and praise the food which sateth them up there.",
    "But when their mutual gratulations ceased, before me each in silence stopped, and flamed so brightly, that my face was forced to bow.",
    "Then, smiling, Beatrice: \"Illustrious life, by whom the generous liberality of our basilica was once described, let Hope resound upon these heavenly heights; thou know'st that thou didst stand for it, as oft as Jesus showed most brightness to the three.\"",
    "\"Lift up thy head, and reassure thyself; for all that cometh from the mortal world up hither, must be ripened in our rays.\"",
    "This comfort reached me from the second fire; hence to the hills I raised mine eyes, which erst had bowed them down by their excessive weight.",
    "\"Since, of His Graciousness, our Emperor wills that thou, before thy death, shouldst face His Counts in His most secret hall; that, having seen the truth in this our court, thou mayst confirm, both in thyself and other souls, the Hope, which rightfully enamors men on earth; say what it is, and how therewith thy mind is blossoming, and whence it came to thee.\" Thus, further, did the second light proceed.",
    "And that kind soul who to so high a flight had led the feathers of my wings, forestalled my answer thus:",
    "\"No child of greater hope hath the Church Militant, as in the Sun is written, which irràdiates all our band, it, therefore, hath been granted him to come from Egypt to Jerusalem, and see, or e'er the period of his warfare end.",
    "Thine other two requests, made not for knowledge, but so that he may carry back with him to what extent this virtue pleases thee, I leave to him, for they will not be hard for him, nor matter for self-praise; to these let him reply, and may God's Grace assist him.\"",
    "Even as in that wherein he expert is, a pupil readily and willingly answers his teacher, that his worth be shown; \"Hope is\" I said, \"a steadfast expectation of future glory, which by Grace divine and by preceding merit is produced.",
    "This light from many stars comes down to me; but he into my heart instilled it first, who was the Greatest Leader's greatest bard.",
    "For \"‘Let them hope in Thee, that know Thy Name!' the latter in his theody declares, and, if he have my faith, who knows it not?",
    "Then, thou with his instilling, didst so greatly instill that hope in me with thine epistle, that, filled with it, I pour your rain on others.\"",
    "While I was speaking, in the living bosom of that great fire, a bright effulgence quivered quickly and often, like a lightning-flash; and then it breathed: \"The love wherewith I still warm to the virtue which once followed me, till with the palm I issued from the field, would have me give my breath to thee again, that dost therein delight; and I am pleased to have thee say what promise Hope affords thee.\"",
    "And I: \"The Scriptures, both the new and old the goal establish of the souls whom God hath made His friends; this points it out to me.",
    "Isaiah says that each in his own land will in a double garment be arrayed; and his own land is this sweet life of ours; and, in a more explicit way, thy brother makes this same revelation manifest to us, where of the snow white robes the treats.\"",
    "After these words had ended, first was heard above us, \"Let them hope in Thee,\" whereto all of the carols made reply; and then a light became so brilliant in their midst, that, if the Crab had such a crystal star, winter would have a month of one sole day.",
    "And as a happy maiden, rising, goes, in honor of the bride, to join the dance, and not for any failing on her part; even so I saw the splendor, brighter grown, approach the two, who in a wheel were turning, as it behooved the ardor of their love.",
    "Into the song and music then it entered; and on the three my Lady kept her gaze, silent and motionless as would a bride.",
    "\"This is the one who on His breast reclined, who is our Pelican, and from the Cross selected was, to hold the filial office.\" Even thus my Lady spoke; but no more after did her words withdraw her eyes from fixed attention, than before.",
    "Even as is he, who gazes at the sun, and tries to see it partially eclipsed, and who, because of seing, groweth blind; such I became before that latest fire, till this was said: \"Why dost thou blind thyself, to see a thing which hath no being here? Earth is my body on the earth, and there will with the others stay, until our number shall with the eternal purpose correspond.",
    "With both their garments in the blessèd cloister are those two Lights alone, which hither rose; and this shalt thou take back unto your world.\"",
    "Stilled was the flaming circle at these words, and with them that sweet mixture which was formed out of the music of the threefold breath, as, from fatigue or danger to escape, oars, which had stroked the water just before, are at a whistle's sound all brought to rest.",
    "Ah, how disturbed in mind I then became, when I turned round to look at Beatrice, because I could not see her now, though close to her I was, and in the happy world!",
    "While I was frightened by my loss of vision, from the refulgent flaming which had quenched it, a breath, which caused me to give heed, came forth, and said: \"Till thou regain the sense of sight which thou hast spent by gazing up at me, 't is well that thou make up for it by speech.",
    "Therefore begin to speak; and say toward what thy soul aspires, and also bear in mind that sight in thee is lost, but not destroyed; because the Lady who is leading thee through this divine expanse, hath in her look the power possessed by Ananias' hand.\"",
    "\"At her own pleasure, soon or late,\" I said, let the cure reach the eyes which portals were, when with that fire she entered, wherewithal I ever burn.",
    "The Good which sates this court is alpha and omega of all scriptures Love reads to me in tones or low or loud.\"",
    "And that same voice which rid me of the fear the sudden blinding blaze had given me, inspired me with a wish to speak again,",
    "and said: \"Thou surely through a finer sieve must pass thy meaning; it behooves thee say who toward so great a target turned thy bow.\"",
    "And I: \"By philosophic arguments, and by authority which from up here descends, must such a love needs stamp itself on me; because the good, when understood as such, enkindles love, and all the greater love, the more it holds of goodness in itself.",
    "Hence to that Being who so perfect is, that every good which lies outside of Him is nothing but a beam of His own radiance, more than to any other must the mind in love be moved, of all who recognize the truth on which this argument is based.",
    "He to mine understanding shows this truth, who demonstrates to me the Primal Love of all the sempiternal substances; the Truthful Author's voice revealeth it, when, speaking of Himself, He saith to Moses: ‘All goodness shall I have thee see.' Thou, too, revealest it to me when thou beginnest the loud announcement which o'er other trumps heralds on earth the secrets of this state.\"",
    "Thereat I heard: \"By human understanding, and by authorities therewith concordant, the sovereign of thy loves is turned to God.",
    "But further say if other cords thou feel attract thee toward Him; so that thou mayst say how many of love's teeth are biting thee.\"",
    "Not hidden was the purpose of Christ's Eagle; nay, rather, I perceived to what he wished to lead my love's profession to declare; hence, \"All those bitings\" I began again, \"which possibly could turn one's heart to God, have with my love of Him concurrent been; for, both the world's existence, and mine own, the death which He endured that I might live, and that which all the faithful hope as I, together with the mentioned living knowledge, have drawn me from the sea of wrong desires, and set me on the shore of righteous love.",
    "I love the several leaves wherewith enleaved is all the garden of the Eternal Gardener, according to the good He giveth each.\"",
    "As soon as I had ceased, a most sweet song throughout all heaven resounded, and my Lady said: \"Holy, Holy, Holy!\" with the rest.",
    "And ev'n as at a vivid flash of light one wakes from sleep, because one's visual power turns toward the ray which moves from coat to coat; and as the one awakened shrinketh back from that which he hath seen, so senseless is his sudden waking, till reflection helps;",
    "thus Beatrice drove all motes from mine eyes by the mere radiance of her own, whose light shone further than a thousand miles away; I, therefore, saw far better than before; then, since I was amazed at it, I asked about a fourth light I beheld with us.",
    "My Lady then: \"In yonder radiant light the first soul which the first Power e'er created is gazing joyfully upon his Maker.\"",
    "Even as a bough which, while the wind is passing, bends its top down, and then uplifts itself, by innate strength which raises it again; even so did I, amazed, while she was speaking; and then the wish to speak, wherewith I burned, made me feel reassured, and I began:",
    "\"O fruit that wast alone produced when ripe, O ancient Father, thou to whom each bride is both a daughter and a daughter-in-law, I beg thee as devoutly as I can to speak to me; thou see'st my wish, hence I, that I may quickly hear thee, tell it not.\"",
    "At times a covered animal so stirs, that its own movement needs must be revealed, because its covering corresponds to it; so likewise did the first of souls display to me, through that which covered it, how gladly he came to give me pleasure.",
    "Then it breathed: \"Without its being told to me by thee, better do I perceive what thou desirest, than thou perceivest what thou knowest best; for I behold it in the Truthful Mirror, which of Itself makes other things a likeness, though naught makes It a likeness of itself.",
    "Thou fain wouldst hear how long it is since God in that high garden placed me, where this Lady prepared thee for so long a flight of stairs; how long it was a pleasure to mine eyes; the real occasion for the mighty wrath; and what the tongue, which I both used and made.",
    "Now, son, the tasting of the tree was not itself the cause of such a banishment, but only the transgression of the bound.",
    "In that place, whence thy Lady started Virgil, I, hence, for this assembly longed four thousand three hundred revolutions of the sun and two; and him I saw return again to all his highway's lights nine hundred times and thirty, while I still abode on earth.",
    "The tongue I spoke had quite extinct become a long time e'er the people under Nimrod attempted their unfinishable task; for never was a product of man's reason apt to endure, for human appetite renews itself according to the heavens.",
    "That mankind speaks, a work of Nature is, but if in this or that way, Nature then leaves you to do according to your pleasure.",
    "Ere I descended to the grieving place below, the Highest Good, from whom proceeds the joy which swathes me, was on earth called I; EL was He called thereafter; this must be, for human custom is, as on a bough a leaf, which goeth as another comes.",
    "Upon the Mount which highest from the sea ascends, I lived, in innocence and sin, from the first hour until the one which follows, after the sun's first quadrant change, the sixth.\"",
    "\"Glory to Father, Son and Holy Ghost!\" all Paradise in such a way began, that its sweet song intoxicated me.",
    "What I was seeing seemed to me a smile as of the Universe; for through both sight and hearing my intoxication entered.",
    "O joy! O gladness inexpressible! O life by love and peace completely filled! O wealth no longer longed for, but assured!",
    "Before mine eyes the torches four remained on fire, and that which was the first to come, began to grow more luminous; and such in its appearance it became, as Jove would come to be, if he and Mars were birds, and interchanged the plumage of their wings.",
    "The Providence, which there above assigns both turn and office, silence had imposed upon the blessèd choir on every side, when \"If I change my color, marvel not\"; I heard him say, \"for ev'n while I am speaking, thou shalt behold all these change color, too.",
    "He who on earth usurps my place, my place, my place, which in the sight of God's own Son is vacant, of my burial ground hath made a sewer of blood and stench; whereby the Pervert, who fell from hence, is there below appeased.\"",
    "The whole of Heaven I then beheld o'erspread with that same hue which colors clouds both morn and evening, when the sun lies opposite; and as a modest lady, who feels sure of her own self, but at another's fault, on merely hearing of it, timid grows; so Beatrice changed her appearance then, and such as hers, I think, was Heaven's eclipse, what time the Sovereign Power suffered pain.",
    "Thereat his words proceeded in a voice so changed from what had been its wonted self, that his appearance had no further changed:",
    "\"The Bride of Christ was not by my blood fed, nor by the blood of Linus, nor by that of Cletus, to be used for gain of gold; but for the winning of this happy life, both Sixtus, Pius, Urban and Calixtus after much lamentation shed their blood.",
    "'T was not our purpose that upon the right of our successors one part of the folk of Christ should sit, and on the left another;",
    "nor that the Keys bestowed in trust on me, should on a banner come to be an emblem, and warfare wage on those that were baptized; nor I become an image on a seal for privileges venal and deceptive, which often make me blush and flame with wrath.",
    "Rapacious wolves disguised in shepherds' clothes are seen in all the pastures from up here.",
    "Vengeance of God, why art thou quiet still? Men of Cahors and Gascons even now prepare to drink our blood.",
    "O good beginning, to what vile ending thou art doomed to fall! But that high Providence, which saved for Rome, through Scipio's help, the glory of the world, will quickly succor her, as I conceive; and thou, my son, who, for thy mortal weight art to return below, open thy mouth, and hide not that which I do not conceal!\"",
    "Ev'n as our atmosphere lets fall great flakes of frozen vapor, when the horn of heaven's she-Goat is in conjunction with the sun; so I beheld the sky grow beautiful and upward flaked with those triumphant flames which for a while had sojourned with us there.",
    "My sight was following their forms, and followed, till the mid space, by reason of its vastness, prevented it from passing further on.",
    "Thereat the Lady who had seen that freed I was from gazing up, said: \"Lower now thine eyes, and see how far thou hast revolved.\"",
    "I saw that since the hour when I had first looked downward, I had moved through all the arc the first of climates makes from mid to end; past Cadiz, hence, Ulysses' insane track I saw, and nearly to the seashore where Europa made herself so sweet a load.",
    "And of this little threshing-floor, much more would have been shown me; but the sun was circling beneath my feet, a sign or more removed.",
    "And my enamored mind, which in my Lady always takes pleasure, more than ever now was burning to restore mine eyes to her.",
    "And if or art or Nature e'er made baits in human flesh or in its painted forms, to catch men's eyes, and capture thus their minds, they all together would seem naught, compared to that divine delight which on me shone, when to her smiling face I turned around; the virtue, therefore, which that look vouchsafed, removed me from fair Leda's lovely nest, and urged me on into the swiftest heaven.",
    "Its nearest and its most exalted parts are all so uniform, I cannot tell which Beatrice selected as my place.",
    "But she who saw my wish began to speak, and smiled so happily, that God appeared to be rejoicing in her countenance:",
    "\"The nature of the world, which quiet holds the center, and around it moves the rest, beginneth here as from its starting-point.",
    "And this heaven hath no other ‘where' than in the Mind Divine, where kindled is the Love which turns it, and the Power itself rains down.",
    "One circle's Light and Love encircle it, as it the other heavens; and He alone this precinct understands, who girdeth it.",
    "Its motion is not measured by another, but all the others are by this, as ten is measured by its half and by its fifth.",
    "And now how time in such a flowerport can have its hidden roots, and in the rest its leaves, hereafter can be manifest to thee.\"",
    "O thou Cupidity, that 'neath thyself dost sink all mortals so, that none avails out of thy waters to withdraw his eyes! The will in human beings blossoms well, but constant rains turn into blighted fruit the genuine plums.",
    "And faith and innocence are found in children only, but take flight, before their cheeks are covered up with hair.",
    "While still a prattler, one observeth fasts, who later, when his tongue is free, devours, under whatever moon, whatever food; and one who, while still lisping, loves and harkens to his mother, later on when speaking well, would see her in her grave.",
    "Thus in the Primal Sight becometh black the white face of the lovely child of him, who brings the morn and leaves the eventide.",
    "And that thou marvel not at this, recall that there is none on earth who rules; and hence the human family goes thus astray.",
    "And yet ere January's month become wholly unwintered, through the hundredth part neglected there below, these upper spheres shall roar so, that the storm so long foreseen will turn the sterns to where the prows are now, so that the fleet will run its course aright, and good fruit follow on the blossom's flower.\"",
    "After the truth against the present life of wretched mortals had been shown to me by her who lifts my mind to Paradise, as in a mirror he perceives its flame, who from behind is lighted by a torch, before he has it in his sight or thought, and turns around to notice if the glass have told the truth, and sees that it accords therewith, as with its music's time a song; so likewise now my memory recalls that I did, as I gazed in those fair eyes, whence Love had made a cord to capture me.",
    "And as I turned around, and mine were touched by that which in that sphere becomes apparent, whene'er one looks intently at its center, a Point I saw, which rays out light so keen that eyes which it enkindles needs must close by reason of its great intensity; and any star that from down here seems smallest, would seem to be a moon, if set beside it, as at each other's side the stars are set.",
    "Perhaps as near as e'er a halo seems to gird the light around, which colors it, when densest is the air which gives it form; a ring of fire was whirling round the Point so swiftly, that it would have overcome the motion which most quickly girds the world; and by another this was girt around, that by a third, as this one by a fourth, then by a fifth the fourth, and by a sixth the fifth.",
    "The seventh came next, outside of these so widely spread, that Juno's messenger, full circled, were too narrow to contain it.",
    "Like these the eighth ring and the ninth; and each more slowly moved, as in its order's number it whirled at greater distance from the first; and that one had the clearest flame of all, whence the Pure Spark least distant was, because, I think, it most in-truths itself therein.",
    "My Lady, who profoundly lost in thought beheld me, said to me: \"On yonder Point Heaven and the whole of Nature are dependent.",
    "Look at the circle most conjoined to It; and know thou that it moves so rapidly because spurred onward by its burning love.\"",
    "And I to her: \"If ordered were the world as I perceive it is in yonder wheels, what is before me set had sated me;",
    "but in the world of sense all revolutions may be perceived to be the more divine as from the center they are more remote; hence, if my longing is to be appeased in this mirific and angelic temple, whose only boundaries are light and love, 't is fit that I hear further why the example and its exemplar do not correspond; for by myself I think on this in vain.\"",
    "\"No wonder is it, if for such a knot thy fingers insufficient are, so hard hath it become, through lack of being tried!\"",
    "My Lady thus; she then continued: \"Take what I shall tell thee, wouldst thou sated be; and on it subtly concentrate thy mind.",
    "The embodied circles wide or narrow are, according to the more or less of virtue distributed through all their several parts.",
    "A greater goodness makes for greater weal; a greater body greater weal bespeaks, if all its parts are perfect equally.",
    "Hence that which with itself sweeps onward all the universe remaining, corresponds to yonder circle which most loves and knows.",
    "If, then, thou stretch thy measure round the virtue, not round the appearance, of the substances which seem arranged in circles to thy sight,",
    "thou 'lt see a marvelous conformity of more to larger and of less to smaller, in every heaven, to its Intelligence.\"",
    "Even as the hemisphere of air remains resplendent and serene, when Boreas blows out of the cheek, from which he mildest proves, whereby the fog which troubled it before, is cleansed and cleared, until the welkin smiles upon us with the charms of all its wards; even such did I become, when once my Lady had with her clear reply provided me, and, like a star in heaven, the truth was seen.",
    "And when her words had ceased, not otherwise doth iron when still boiling scintillate, than yonder circles sparkled.",
    "Every spark followed its Kindler; and so many were they, that their whole number far more thousands counts, than ever did the doubling of the chess.",
    "From choir to choir I heard Hosanna sung to that Fixed Point which holds them at the ‘where,' and ever will, where they have always been.",
    "And she who in my mind my doubtful thoughts was seeing, said: \"The primal rings have shown the Seraphs to thee, and the Cherubim.",
    "Thus swiftly do they heed their bonds, to make them as like the Point as may be, and as like It they can be, as their vision is sublime.",
    "Those other loves that round about them move, Thrones of the Countenance Divine are called, and for this reason end the primal triad.",
    "And thou shouldst know that all of them are happy, according as their vision plumbs the Truth, wherein all understanding is at rest.",
    "From this it may be seen how blessedness is founded on the faculty which sees, and not on that which loves and follows after; the measure of this vision is the merit, which both of Grace and of good will is born; such, then, is their advance from grade to grade.",
    "The second triad which, like that above, produces buds in this eternal spring, whose foliage no nocturnal Aries spoils, sings endlessly its vernal song of praise to three sweet melodies, which sound in three orders of joy, wherewith it trines itself.",
    "Three goddesses are in that hierarchy; the Dominations first, the Virtues next; the third one is the Order of the Powers.",
    "Then, in the last two dancing choirs but one, with Principalities Archangels whirl; the last is wholly of Angelic Joys.",
    "All these Angelic orders upward look, and downward so prevail, that all to God attracted are, and all in turn attract.",
    "And Dionysius with such great desire gave himself up to contemplate these orders, that he both named and graded them as I; but with him, later, Gregory disagreed, and hence, as soon as ever in this heaven he oped his eyes, at his own self he smiled.",
    "Nor would I have thee wonder that on earth a mortal should disclose a truth so secret, for he who saw it here, revealed it to him, with many other truths about these rings.\"",
    "When, by the Ram and by the Scales surmounted, both children of Latona make together a girdle of the earth's horizon line, as long as from the moment when the zenith holds them in equipoise, till from that girdle both free themselves by changing hemisphere; only so long did Beatrice keep silent, a smile her face adorning, as she gazed intently on the Point which vanquished me.",
    "She then began: \"I tell, but do not ask, what thou art fain to hear, for I have seen it where every Where and every When is fixed.",
    "Not for the gain of good unto Himself, which is not possible, but that His Splendor might in resplendency declare ‘I AM,' in His Eternity, outside of time, out of all limits else, the Eternal Love, as pleased Him, in new loves disclosed Himself.",
    "Nor yet ere this did He remain inert, for neither after nor before, occurred God's going to and fro upon these waters.",
    "Both form and matter, simple and conjoined, came into being which had no defect, even as three arrows from a three-stringed bow; and as in glass, in amber or in crystal, a ray so shines, that from the time it comes till its completion, is no interval; thus from its Lord did that triform effect ray forth into its being all at once, without distinction as to its beginning.",
    "Order was concreate, and for the substances ordained; and highest in the world were those in whom activity was brought forth pure.",
    "Pure potentiality the lowest place assumed; and 'tween these two so strong a bond activity and potentiality conjoined, that never will it be unbound.",
    "Jerome concerning Angels wrote for you that their creation was an age-long tract of time before the remnant world was made; but written is this truth in many places by writers of the Holy Ghost; and there thou 'lt see it, if but carefully thou look; and reason, too, sees this to some extent, for it could not acknowledge that the Motors could be so long deprived of their perfection.",
    "And now thou knowest where and when these loves created were, and how; hence in thy longing three ardors have already been extinguished.",
    "Nor, counting, would one reach as far as twenty, as quickly as a portion of the Angels disturbed the lowest of your elements.",
    "The rest remained; and with such great delight began the art, which thou beholdest here, that never from their circling have they ceased.",
    "The Fall's occasion was the cursèd pride of him, whom thou didst see oppressed by all the burdens of the world.",
    "Those whom thou here beholdest, modest were, and recognized themselves as from that Goodness sprung, which apt had made them for such great intelligence.",
    "And therefore by illuminating Grace, and by their merit, was their sight so raised, that now a full and steadfast will is theirs.",
    "Nor would I have thee doubt, but be assured, that to receive God's Grace is meritorious, according as affection opes to it.",
    "And now concerning this consistory, much canst thou contemplate without more help, if thou hast apprehended well my words.",
    "But seeing that on earth throughout your schools men teach that such the Angelic nature is, that it both understands, recalls and wills, I'll further speak, that thou the simple truth mayst see, which there below confounded is, because the doctrine taught equivocates.",
    "These substances, e'er since the face of God first gladdened them, have not withdrawn their eyes therefrom, whence nothing is concealed.",
    "They have no vision which is interrupted, therefore, by objects new to them, and hence need not remember by divided thought; folk, therefore, dream down there, though not asleep, some thinking that their words are true, some not; but greater is the latter's sin and shame.",
    "And ye down yonder follow not one path, when ye philosophize; so much doth love of show, and being famed for it, transport you.",
    "And yet with even less disdain is this endured up here, than when the Holy Scripture is set aside, or turned to wrong account.",
    "No one considers there how much it costs to sow it in the world, or how much he, who humbly clings to it, gives pleasure here.",
    "Each strives to call attention to himself, making his own inventions; these are taught by preachers, while the Gospel's voice is stilled.",
    "One says that while the Christ was suffering death the moon turned back, and interposed herself; and hence the sun's light failed to reach the earth; others that of its own accord the light concealed itself, hence its eclipse affected Spaniards and Hindoos, as it did the Jews.",
    "Florence hath not so many Lapi and Bindi as fables such as these, which all year long are shouted from the pulpits everywhere; hence the poor sheep, who do not know, return from pasture fed on wind; nor doth the fact that they see not that they are harmed, excuse them.",
    "Christ did not say to His first company: \"Go and preach idle stories to the world!\" but gave them a foundation for the truth; and that alone found utterance from their lips; therefore, when striving to enkindle faith, they used the Gospel as their shield and lance.",
    "Men now go forth to preach with jests and tricks, and so, if but a hearty laugh is raised, the cowl puffs up, and nothing more is asked.",
    "But in its tail there nestles such a bird, that if the crowd perceived it, it would see what that forgiveness is, in which it trusts; therefore such folly hath increased on earth, that without proof or other attestation, to any kind of promise men would flock.",
    "Saint Anthony is fattening thus his pig, and others also fouler far than his, by paying money void of coinage stamp.",
    "But since a great digression we have made, turn thine eyes backward to the straight road now, that thus our way be shortened with our time.",
    "This nature so exceedingly extends in number, that there never was or speech, or mortal thought, that could extend so far.",
    "And if thou look at that which is disclosed by Daniel, thou wilt see that in his ‘thousands' no well determined number is revealed.",
    "The Primal Light, which rays out on it all, is in as many ways therein received, as are the lights wherewith It pairs Itself; hence, since affection follows on the act which understands, love's sweetness is therein burning or warm in different degrees.",
    "And now see how exceeding high and broad is that Eternal Worth, which makes Itself so many mirrors, whereupon It breaks, while in Itself, as erst, remaining One!\"",
    "The sixth hour glows perhaps six thousand miles away from us, and now our world inclines its shadow to a nearly level bed; mid-heaven the while, which lies so deep above us, is growing such, that now and then a star is lost to our perception here below; till, as the brightest handmaid of the sun advances further, star by star, the sky, even to the fairest, closes to our view.",
    "Not otherwise the Triumph, which forever plays round about the Point which vanquished me, and seems contained by what Itself contains, little by little faded from my sight; my seeing nothing, therefore, and my love forced me to look again at Beatrice.",
    "If what has hitherto been said of her were all included in a single praise, but little would it serve my present turn.",
    "The beauty which I then beheld, transcends not us alone, but truly I believe its Maker only can enjoy it all.",
    "And herewith I confess myself o'erwhelmed more than a tragic or a comic poet was ever by a crisis in his theme; for as the sun the sight that trembles most, so the remembrance of her lovely smile deprives my memory of its very self.",
    "From the first day when I beheld her face in this life, till this present sight of it, I've never ceased from following her in song; but now must my pursuit desist from tracing her beauty's progress further in my verse, as at his utmost every artist must.",
    "Such, as I leave her to a louder cry than that of mine own trump, which draweth now its arduous matter to its closing, she, with a quick leader's mien and voice, resumed:",
    "\"We now have issued from the greatest body into the Heaven which is itself pure Light; Light intellectual which is full of Love, Love of true Goodness which is full of Joy; Joy which transcendeth every kind of Pleasure.",
    "Here both the soldieries of Paradise shalt thou behold, and one in that array, which at the Final Judgment thou shalt see.\"",
    "Like a quick lightning-flash which scatters so the visual faculties that it prevents the eye's reacting to the brightest objects;",
    "ev'n so a living Light around me shone, and left me swathed about by such a veil of its effulgence, that I lost my sight.",
    "\"The Love which calms this last heaven always welcomes into its midst by greetings such as this, and thus adapts the candle to the flame.\"",
    "No sooner had these few brief words of hers attained mine inner ear, than I perceived that I was being raised above my powers; hence, with new sight I so rekindled me, that there cannot exist so bright a light that now mine eyes could not endure to see it.",
    "Light in a River's form I then beheld, which glowed refulgently between two banks, adorned with wondrous hues of early spring.",
    "And from this River issued living sparks, which settled everywhere among the flowers, and looked like rubies set in gold; and then, as if intoxicated by its odors, into the wondrous River plunged again, another coming out, if one went in.",
    "\"The deep desire which now inflameth thee, and urges thee to know what thou art seeing, the better pleases me, the more it grows.",
    "But of this water it behooves thee drink, before so great a thirst as thine is slaked.\" So said to me the Sunlight of mine eyes.",
    "\"The River and the topaz lights, which come and go,\" she added, \"and the smiling grass are prefaces foreshadowing their truth; not that imperfect in themselves they are, but that deficiency exists in thee, because thy sight is not yet strong enough.\"",
    "There is no little child that turns its face so quickly toward its milk, on waking up much later than hath been its wont, as I, to make far better mirrors of mine eyes, leaned over toward the Stream which only flows that we therein may be the better made.",
    "Soon as mine eyelids' eaves had drunk of it, it seemed to me transformed from long to round; and then, like folk who under masks have been, and different seem from what they were before, when once divested of the alien looks, wherein their self had disappeared; ev'n so the flowers and sparks had changed themselves for me into a feast far greater, so that clearly I now beheld both Courts of Heaven revealed.",
    "O Splendor of my God, whereby I saw the exalted Triumph of the Realm of Truth, give me the power to tell what I perceived!",
    "There is a Light up yonder, which allows its Maker to be seen by every creature which only hath its peace in seeing Him;",
    "and in a circle's form it spreadeth out to such extent, that its circumference would be too broad a girdle for the sun.",
    "Its whole appearance from a ray proceeds reflected from the summit of the First Moved Sphere, which from it takes its life and potency.",
    "And as within the water at its base a hill reflects itself, as if to see its slopes adorned, when rich with leaves and flowers; thus, ranged above and all around the Light, mirrored on o'er a thousand tiers I saw all that of us have yet returned up there.",
    "And if the lowest row within itself gathers so great a light, how great must be this Rose's width in its remotest petals?",
    "Nor did my vision of its breadth or height lose itself in them, but embraced the whole extent and inmost nature of this Joy.",
    "There near, nor far, nor add, nor take away; for there where God unmediated rules, in no way doth the natural law obtain.",
    "Into the yellow of the Eternal Rose, which outward spreads in tiers, whose fragrance praises the Sun which makes an everlasting spring, was I, like one who, fain to speak, keeps silent, led on by Beatrice, who said to me: \"Behold how vast the white robed Convent is!",
    "Behold how wide the circuit of our Town! Behold our benches so completely filled, that few are now the people longed for here!",
    "On that great seat, whereon thine eyes are fixed by reason of the crown which rests there now, or e'er thou sup at this our wedding feast, shall sit the soul, august to be below, of that great Henry who shall come to set Italia straight, ere she shall be prepared.",
    "The blinding greed which now bewitches you hath made you mortals like a child, who, though he die of hunger, drives his nurse away.",
    "And in the sacred Forum such an one shall Prefect be, that he'll not go one road with him, in open or in covert ways.",
    "But in his holy office he will not be long endured by God; for hurled he'll be where Simon Magus is for his reward, and deeper down shall thrust Alagna's man.\"",
    "In semblance, therefore, of a pure white Rose the sacred soldiery which with His blood Christ made His Bride, revealed itself to me; meanwhile the other host, which, flying, sees the glory of Him who wins its love, and sings the goodness which had made them all so great, was, like a swarm of bees, which now inflowers itself, and now returns to where its toil is sweetened, ever coming down to enter the spacious Flower, which with so many leaves adorns itself, and reascending thence to where its Love forever makes His home.",
    "The faces of them all were living flames, their wings were golden, and the rest so white, that never is such whiteness reached by snow.",
    "When down into the Flower they came, they spread from bench to bench the peace and ardent love, which by the fanning of their sides they won.",
    "Nor did so vast a host of flying forms between the flower and that which o'er it lies, hinder the sight, or dim the splendor seen;",
    "because the Light Divine so penetrates the Universe, according to its worth, that naught can be an obstacle thereto.",
    "And this secure and joyous Kingdom, thronged by people of the ages old and new, wholly on one Mark set its looks and love.",
    "O Trinal Light, that in a Single Star, sparkling before their eyes, dost so appease them, look down upon our tempest here below!",
    "If the Barbarians — coming from a region, above which Helicë looms every day, while circling with the son who is her joy, on seeing Rome and all her lofty buildings, what time the Lateran rose eminent o'er every mortal thing — were wonderstruck; how overwhelmed with awe must I have been, I, who from human things, to things divine, from time, into eternity had come, from Florence — to a people just and sane! Because of this, indeed, and of my joy, it pleased me to be mute and hear no sound.",
    "And ev'n as in the temple of his vow, when hoping to describe it all some day, a pilgrim looks around him, and is cheered; ev'n so, while wandering through the living Light, I turned mine eyes on all the graded ranks, circling now up, now down, and now around.",
    "There love-persuasive faces I beheld, decked by Another's light and their own smiles, and gestures fraught with grace and dignity.",
    "My look now as a whole had comprehended the general form of Paradise, but had not yet settled especially on any part; and I was longing with rekindled wish to ask my Lady as to many things, concerning which my mind was in suspense.",
    "Though one thing I had meant, another answered; thinking to look at Beatrice, an elder I saw arrayed as are the glorious folk.",
    "His eyes and cheeks were all suffused with joy and kindliness, and such his pious mien, as fitting is a father's tenderness.",
    "Hence \"Where is she?\" I said impulsively; and he: \"To bring thy longing to an end, was I by Beatrice from mine own place withdrawn; and if upon the highest rank's third round thou look, thou shalt again behold her enthroned where her deserts allotted her.\"",
    "Without reply I lifted up mine eyes, and saw her, as, reflecting from herself the eternal rays, she made herself a crown.",
    "Not from the tract whence highest thunders peal is any mortal eye so far removed from whatsoever sea it fathoms most.",
    "as Beatrice was distant from mine eyes; but naught was that to me, because her face came down to me unblurred by aught between.",
    "\"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong, and who for my salvation didst endure to leave the traces of thy feet in Hell, I recognize the virtue and the grace of all the many things which I have seen, as coming from thy power and kindliness.",
    "From slavery to freedom thou hast drawn me in every way, and over every path, within thy power to achieve that end.",
    "Guard thou in me the fruitage of thy bounty, that thus my soul, restored to health by thee, may, when it leaves my body, please thee still!\"",
    "I thus implored; and she, though so far off she seemed, looked down at me and smiled; then to the Eternal Fount she turned again.",
    "Thereat the holy elder said: \"That thou mayst bring thy journey to its perfect end, for which both prayers and holy love have sent me, hover about this Garden with thine eyes, for to have seen it will prepare thy look to rise still higher through the Ray Divine.",
    "The Queen of Heaven, for whom I wholly burn with love, will grant us this and very grace, for I her faithful servant Bernard am.\"",
    "As he who from Croatia comes, perchance, to look at our Veronica, and who, because of its old fame, is never sated, but says in thought, as long as it is shown: \"My Lord, Christ Jesus, God in very truth, was, then, your countenance like unto this?\" even such was I, as on the living love I gazed on him, who in this world received a taste, in contemplation, of that Peace.",
    "\"This glad existence, son of Grace,\" he then began, \"will not be known to thee, if fixed at this low level only are thine eyes.",
    "Look at the circles, to the most remote, till yonder thou behold that Queen enthroned, to whom devoutly subject is this Realm.\"",
    "I raised mine eyes; and as at early morn the horizon's eastern parts excel in light the regions where the sun is setting; so, as with mine eyes from vale to mount I moved, I saw a region at the utmost verge vanquish in light all other parts before me.",
    "And as the skies where one awaits the car which Phaethon badly drove, more brightly gleam, while pale the light on either side becomes; so likewise, brilliant in the middle loomed that peaceful Oriflamme, and on each side the fire in equal measure burned less bright.",
    "And clustered there with wings outspread I saw more than a thousand Angels jubilant, and each distinct in splendor and in speed; while smiling down upon their sports and songs a Beauty I beheld, who was the joy within the eyes of all the other Saints.",
    "And even if I in utterance were as rich as in imagination, I 'd not dare attempt to tell the least of its delight.",
    "When Bernard saw mine eyes intently fixed upon the object of his ardent love, he turned to it his own with such affection, that mine more eager grew to look again.",
    "Intent on his delight, that contemplator the office of a teacher took unasked, and thereupon began these holy words:",
    "\"The one so beautiful at Mary's feet is she who opened and who made the wound, which Mary closed again, and then anointed.",
    "In the order which up there the third seats make, Rachel beneath her sits with Beatrice, as thou perceivest.",
    "Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and she who was that singer's ancestress, who said when he was grieving for his sin: \"Have mercy on me,\" thou canst thus behold downward from rank to rank, as each I name, and through the Rose decline from leaf to leaf.",
    "Descending from the seventh row of seats, even as above it, Hebrew women follow, dividing all the tresses of the Flower; for in accordance with the attitude their faith assumed toward Christ, these women form the wall which separates the sacred steps.",
    "On this side, where full-bloomed the Flower is, complete with all its leaves, are seated those who in the Christ that was to come believed; and on the other, where the semicircles are interrupted by still vacant seats, are those who faced toward Christ already come.",
    "And as on this side here the glorious throne of Heaven's own Lady, and the other seats beneath it, such a great partition make; so, opposite, the seat of that great John, who, ever holy, underwent the desert and martyrdom, and then two years in Hades; while Francis, Benedict and Augustine beneath him were decreed to form the line with others down to here, from round to round.",
    "And now behold how great God's foresight is; for each of these two aspects of the Faith will fill this Garden to the same extent.",
    "And know that downward from the row of seats, which midway separates the two divisions, no one is seated for his own deserts, but for another's, under fixed conditions; for all of these are spirits who were freed before they had the power to really choose.",
    "This by their faces thou canst well perceive, and by their childish voices furthermore, if, looking at them well, thou listen, too.",
    "Thou doubtest now, and, doubting, thou art silent; but I will set thee free from that strong bond wherein thy subtle thoughts are holding thee.",
    "Within the ample nature of this Realm nothing can any more occur by chance, than either sadness, thirst or hunger can; for in accordance with eternal law is settled all thou seest, so that here close-fitting to the finger is the ring.",
    "These people, therefore, who before their time have reached true life, are not without good cause more excellent, or less, among themselves.",
    "The King, through whom this Kingdom finds repose in such delight and love, that no one's will is bold enough to long for any greater; creating all minds in His own glad sight, as Him it pleases, dowers each with Grace in divers ways; here let the fact suffice.",
    "And this is clearly and expressly marked for you in Holy Scripture by those twins who in their mother had their wrath aroused.",
    "According to the color of the hair of that Grace, therefore, must the Light supreme be worthily accorded as a crown.",
    "Without deserving aught, then, for their deeds, are these to different grades assigned, which differ in their innate keen-sightedness alone.",
    "The faith of parents only was, indeed, with innocence, enough for their salvation, throughout the centuries of early times.",
    "Then, when the primal ages had elapsed, males were by circumcision forced to win the virtue needed by their guileless wings; but later, when the age of Grace had come, without the perfect baptism in the Christ, such innocence was there below retained.",
    "But now look at the face which to the Christ is most resemblant; for its light alone can make thee ready to behold the Christ.\"",
    "I saw such gladness raining down on her, borne by those holy minds, created such that they might fly across those altitudes, that whatsoever I had seen before ne'er held me with such admiration poised, nor showed me such resemblance unto God.",
    "And that same love which first descended there, \"Ave Maria, Gratia plena,\" singing, spread out his open wings in front of her.",
    "And on all sides the beatific Court made such an answer to the song divine, that every face became the more serene.",
    "\"O holy father, who for me dost bear to be down here, and leave the pleasant place, where by eternal lot thou hast thy seat,",
    "who is that Angel who with such delight is at our Queen's eyes gazing, and is so enamored, that he seems to be on fire?\"",
    "For teaching I had thus recourse again to him who was from Mary drawing beauty, as from the sun the early morning star.",
    "And he to me: \"As much self-trust and grace as can be in an Angel or a soul, are all in him; and we would have it so; for he it was who carried down the palm to Mary, when God's Son upon Himself was pleased to take the burden of our flesh.",
    "But with thine eyes now follow after me, as I keep speaking; and note the great Patricians of this most just and kind Imperial State.",
    "The two that have the happiest seats up there, because the nearest to Augusta's throne, are, as it were, the two roots of this Rose.",
    "He that upon the left is at her side, that Father is, because of whose bold taste the human species tastes such bitterness; and on her right thou see'st that ancient Father of Holy Church, to whom Christ gave in trust the Keys of this fair Flower.",
    "And he who saw, ere dying, all that fair Bride's troubled days, who with the spear and with the nails was won, beside him sits; and at the other's side",
    "that Leader rests, 'neath whom the ingrate folk, stiff-necked and fickle-minded, lived on manna.",
    "Anna thou seest sitting opposite to Peter, so content to see her daughter, that never from her doth she move her eyes, although ‘Hosanna!' singing; o'er against the oldest Father of a family Lucaa sits, who had thy Lady go, when thou thy brows in downward flight didst turn.",
    "But since apace thy slumber-time is fleeing, here will we pause, as that good tailor does, who cuts his gown according to his cloth; and toward the Primal Love direct our eyes, that, looking toward Him, thou mayst penetrate as far into His Splendor as thou canst.",
    "But lest, perchance, by moving thine own wings, thou shouldst recede, believing to advance, Grace needs must be obtained for thee by prayer; Grace from the one who hath the power to help thee; hence follow after me with thine affection, that from my words thy heart turn not aside.\"",
    "He then began the following holy prayer: \"O Virgin Mother, Daughter of thy Son, humbler and loftier than any creature, eternal counsel's predetermined goal, thou art the one that such nobility didst lend to human nature, that its Maker scorned not to make Himself what He had made.",
    "Within thy womb rekindled was the Love, through whose warm influence in the eternal Peace this Flower hath blossomed thus.",
    "Here unto us thou art a noonday torch of Charity; and down below 'mong mortal men, thou art a living fount of Hope.",
    "Lady, so great thou art, and hast such worth, that one who longs for Grace, and unto thee hath not recourse, wingless would wish to have his longing fly.",
    "Not only doth thy Kindliness give help to him that asketh it, but many times it freely runs ahead of his request.",
    "In thee is Mercy, Pity is in thee, in thee Magnificence, and all there is of Goodness in a creature meets in thee.",
    "Now doth this man, who from the lowest drain of the Universe hath one by one beheld, as far as here, the forms of spirit-life, beseech thee, of thy grace, for so much strength that with his eyes he may uplift himself toward Ultimate Salvation higher still.",
    "And I, who never for mine own sight burned more than I do for his, offer thee all my prayers, and pray that they be not too poor, that thou with thy prayers so dissolve each cloud of his mortality, that unto him the Highest Pleasure may unfold Itself.",
    "And furthermore, I pray to thee, O Queen, who canst whate'er thou wilt, that, after such a sight, thou keep all his affections sound.",
    "His human promptings let thy care defeat; see with how many blest ones Beatrice is clasping for my prayers her hands to thee!\"",
    "The eyes belovèd and revered by God, intent on him who prayed, revealed to us how grateful unto her are earnest prayers.",
    "Thence they addressed them to the Eternal Light, wherein it may not be believed the eye of any creature finds so clear a way.",
    "And I, who to the End of all desires was drawing near, within me, as I ought, brought to its goal the ardor of desire.",
    "Bernard was smiling, and was making signs for me to look on high; but, as he wished, I was already of mine own accord; because my sight, as purer it became, was penetrating more and more the radiance of that High Light, which of Itself is true.",
    "From this time onward greater was my sight than is our speech, which yields to such a vision, and memory also yields to such excess.",
    "And such as he, who seeth in a dream, and after it, the imprinted feeling stays, while all the rest returns not to his mind; even such am I; for almost wholly fades my vision, yet the sweetness which was born of it is dripping still into my heart.",
    "Even thus the snow is in the sun dissolved; even thus the Sibyl's oracles, inscribed on flying leaves, were lost adown the wind.",
    "O Light Supreme, that dost uplift Thyself so far from mortal thought, relend my mind a little of what Thou didst seem to be, and cause my tongue to be so powerful, that of Thy Glory it may leave at least a spark unto the people still to come; for to my mem'ry if it but a while return, and speak a little in these lines, more of Thy Victory will be conceived.",
    "I think the keenness of the living Ray which I endured would have confounded me, if from it I had turned away mine eyes.",
    "And I recall that I, because of this, the bolder was to bear it, till I made my vision one with Value Infinite.",
    "O the abundant Grace, whereby I dared to pierce the Light Eternal with my gaze, until I had therein exhausted sight!",
    "I saw that far within its depths there lies, by Love together in one volume bound, that which in leaves lies scattered through the world; substance and accident, and modes thereof, fused, as it were, in such a way, that that, whereof I speak, is but One Simple Light.",
    "This union's general form I think I saw, since, saying so, I feel that I the more rejoice.",
    "Of more forgetfulness for me one moment is, than centuries twenty-five are for the enterprise which once caused Neptune to wonder at the shadow Argo cast.",
    "My mind, thus wholly in suspense, was gazing steadfast and motionless, and all intent, and, gazing, grew enkindled more and more.",
    "Such in that Light doth one at last become, that one can never possibly consent to turn therefrom for any other sight;",
    "because the Good, which is the will's real object, is therein wholly gathered, and, outside, that is defective which is perfect there.",
    "Ev'n as to what I do remember, mine will now be shorter than an infant's speech, who at the breast still bathes his tongue.",
    "'T was not that there was other than a simple semblance within the Living Light wherein I gazed, which always is what It hath been before; but through my sight, which in me, as I looked, was gathering strength, because I changed, one sole appearance underwent a change for me.",
    "Within the Lofty Light's profound and clear subsistence there appeared to me three Rings, of threefold color and of one content; and one, as Rainbow is by Rainbow, seemed reflected by the other, while the third seemed like a Fire breathed equally from both.",
    "Oh, how, to my conception, short and weak is speech! And this, to what I saw, is such, that it is not enough to call it small.",
    "O Light Eternal, that alone dost dwell within Thyself, alone dost understand Thyself, and love and smile upon Thyself, Self-understanding and Self-understood!",
    "That Circle which appeared to be conceived within Thyself as a Reflected Light, when somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,",
    "within Itself, of Its own very color, to me seemed painted with our Human Form; whence wholly set upon It was my gaze.",
    "Like the geometer, who gives himself wholly to measuring the circle, nor, by thinking, finds the principle he needs; ev'n such was I at that new sight.",
    "I wished to see how to the Ring the Image there conformed Itself, and found therein a place; but mine own wings were not enough for this; had not my mind been smitten by a flash of light, wherein what it was willing came.",
    "Here power failed my high imagining; but, like a smoothly moving wheel, that Love was now revolving my desire and will, which moves the sun and all the other stars."]
